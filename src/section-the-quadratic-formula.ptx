        <title>Solving Quadratic Equations with the Quadratic Formula</title>

        <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation is <me>ax^2+bx+c=0</me> Let's look at two examples as a review of solving quadratic equations.</p>

        <p>First, let's look at when <m>b=0</m> and the equation looks like <m>ax^2+c=0</m>. One way to solve this type of equation is with the square root property.</p>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>Solve for <m>x</m> in <m>x^2-4=0</m>.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p><md>
                    <mrow>x^2-4\amp=0</mrow>
                    <mrow>x^2\amp=4</mrow></md><md>
                    <mrow>x\amp=-2\amp\text{or}\amp\amp x\amp=2</mrow>
                </md>The solution set is <m>\{-2,2\}</m>.</p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <p>Second, if we can factor the left side of the equation in <m>ax^2+bx+c=0</m>, then we can solve the equation by factoring.</p>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>Solve for <m>x</m> in <m>x^2-4x-12=0</m>.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p><md>
                    <mrow>x^2-4x-12\amp=0</mrow>
                    <mrow>(x-6)(x+2)\amp=0</mrow></md><md>
                    <mrow>x-6\amp=0\amp\text{or}\amp\amp x+2\amp=0</mrow>
                    <mrow>x\amp=6\amp\text{or}\amp\amp x\amp=-2</mrow>
                </md>The solution set is <m>\{-2,6\}</m>.</p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <p>A third method for solving a quadratic equation is to use what is known as the quadratic formula.</p>

        <fact xml:id="fact-the-quadratic-formula"><idx><h>solving</h><h>quadratic equations</h><h>quadratic formula</h></idx>
            <title>The Quadratic Formula</title>
            <p>For any quadratic equation <m>ax^2+bx+c=0</m>, the solutions are given by <me>x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}</me></p>
        </fact>

        <p>As we have seen from solving quadratic equations, there can be at most two solutions. Both of the solutions are included in the quadratic formula with the <m>\pm</m> symbol. We could write the two solutions separately as<md>
        <mrow>x=\frac{-b-\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\amp\amp\text{ or }\amp\amp x=\frac{-b+\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}</mrow></md>
        but it is more efficient to simplify them together.</p>

        <p>This method for solving quadratic equations will work to solve <em>every</em> quadratic equation. It is most helpful  when <m>b\ne0</m> and when <m>ax^2+bx+c</m> cannot be factored. In this section, we will only focus on how to use the formula.</p>

        <p>In <xref ref="section-solving-quadratic-equations-by-factoring">Section</xref>, we saw an example where a physics class launched a tennis ball off the roof of a building. In that example, the numbers were simplified so we could solve it by factoring. Now we will solve a similar example with more realistic numbers.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-quadratic-equation-flying-object">
            <statement>
                <p>Linh is in another physics class that launches a tennis ball from a rooftop that is <m>90.2</m> feet above the ground. They fire it directly upward at a speed of <m>14.4</m> feet per second and measure the time it takes for the ball to hit the ground below. We can model the height of the tennis ball, <m>h</m>, in feet, with the quadratic equation <m>h=-16x^2+14.4x+90.2</m>, where <m>x</m> represents the time in seconds after the launch. According to the model, when should the ball hit the ground? Round the time to one decimal place.</p>

                <p>The ground has a height of <m>0</m> feet. Substituting <m>0</m> for <m>h</m> in the equation, we have this quadratic equation:
                <me>0=-16x^2+14.4x+90.2</me>
                We cannot solve this equation with factoring or the square root property, so we will use the quadratic formula. First we will identify that <m>\highlight{a=-16}</m>, <m>\highlight{b=14.4}</m> and <m>\highlight{c=90.2}</m>, and substitute them into the formula:<md>
                    <mrow>x\amp=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}</mrow>
                    <mrow>x\amp=\frac{-(\substitute{14.4})\pm\sqrt{(\substitute{14.4})^2-4(\substitute{-16})(\substitute{90.2})}}{2(\substitute{-16})}</mrow>
                    <mrow>x\amp=\frac{-14.4\pm\sqrt{207.36-(-5772.8)}}{-32}</mrow>
                    <mrow>x\amp=\frac{-14.4\pm\sqrt{207.36+5772.8}}{-32}</mrow>
                    <mrow>x\amp=\frac{-14.4\pm\sqrt{5980.16}}{-32}</mrow>
                    <intertext>These are the exact solutions but because we have a context we want to approximate the solutions with decimals.</intertext>
                    <mrow>x\amp\approx-2.0\text{ or }x\approx2.9</mrow>
                </md>We don't use the negative solution because a negative time does not make sense in this context. The ball will hit the ground approximately <m>2.9</m> seconds after it is launched.</p>
            </statement>
        </example>

        <p>The quadratic formula can be used to solve any quadratic equation, but it requires that you don't make <em>any</em> slip-up with remembering the formula, that you correctly identify <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m>, and that you don't make any arithmetic mistakes when you calculate and simplify. We recommend that you always check whether you can factor or use the square root property before using the quadratic formula. Here is another example.</p>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>Solve for <m>x</m> in <m>2x^2-9x+5=0</m>.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>First, we check and see that we cannot factor the left side (because we can't find two numbers that multiply to <m>10</m> and add to <m>-9</m>) or use the square root property (because <m>b\neq0</m>) so we must use the quadratic formula. Next we identify that <m>\highlight{a=2}</m>, <m>\highlight{b=-9}</m> and <m>\highlight{c=5}</m>. We will substitute them into the quadratic formula:<md>
                    <mrow>x\amp=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}</mrow>
                    <mrow>x\amp=\frac{-(\substitute{-9})\pm\sqrt{(\substitute{-9})^2-4(\substitute{2})(\substitute{5})}}{2(\substitute{2})}</mrow>
                    <mrow>x\amp=\frac{-9\pm\sqrt{81-40}}{4}</mrow>
                    <mrow>x\amp=\frac{-9\pm\sqrt{41}}{4}</mrow></md>
                    This is fully simplified because we cannot simplify <m>\sqrt{41}</m> or reduce the fraction. The solution set is <m>\left\{\frac{-9-\sqrt{22}}{4},\frac{-9+\sqrt{22}}{4}\right\}</m>. We do not have a context here so we leave the solutions in their exact form.</p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <p>When a quadratic equation is not in standard form we must convert it before we can identify the values of <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> and <m>c</m>. We will show that in the next example.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-solve-quadratic-equation-using-quadratic-formula">
            <statement>
                <p>Solve for <m>x</m> in <m>x^2=-10x-3</m>.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>First, we convert the equation into standard form by adding <m>10x</m> and <m>3</m> to each side of the equation:
                    <me>x^2+10x+3=0</me>
                   Next, we check and see that we cannot factor the left side or use the square root property so we must use the quadratic formula. We identify that <m>\highlight{a=1}</m>, <m>\highlight{b=10}</m> and <m>\highlight{c=3}</m>. We will substitute them into the quadratic formula:<md>
                    <mrow>x\amp=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}</mrow>
                    <mrow>x\amp=\frac{-\substitute{10}\pm\sqrt{(\substitute{10})^2-4(\substitute{1})(\substitute{3})}}{2(\substitute{1})}</mrow>
                    <mrow>x\amp=\frac{-10\pm\sqrt{100-12}}{2}</mrow>
                    <mrow>x\amp=\frac{-10\pm\sqrt{88}}{2}</mrow></md>
                    Now we need to simplify the square root:<md>
                    <mrow>x\amp=\frac{-10\pm2\sqrt{22}}{2}</mrow>
                    <intertext>Lastly we need to reduce the fractions, which can be done by separating terms:</intertext>
                    <mrow>x\amp=\frac{-10}{2}\pm\frac{2\sqrt{22}}{2}</mrow>
                    <mrow>x\amp=-5\pm\sqrt{22}</mrow>
                </md>The solution set is <m>\{-5-\sqrt{22}, -5+\sqrt{22}\}</m>.</p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <remark><p>The irrational solutions to quadratic equations can be checked, although doing so can sometimes involve a lot of simplification and is not shown throughout this section. As an example, to check the solution of <m>-5+\sqrt{22}</m> from <xref ref="example-solve-quadratic-equation-using-quadratic-formula">Example</xref>, we would replace <m>x</m> with <m>-5+\sqrt{22}</m> and check that the two sides of the equation are equal. This check is shown here:
        <md>
            <mrow>x^2\amp=-10x-3</mrow>
            <mrow>(\substitute{-5+\sqrt{22}})^2\amp\stackrel{?}{=}-10(\substitute{-5+\sqrt{22}})-3</mrow>
            <mrow>(-5)^2+2(-5)(\sqrt{22})+(\sqrt{22})^2\amp\stackrel{?}{=}-10(-5+\sqrt{22})-3</mrow>
            <mrow>25-10\sqrt{22}+22 \amp\stackrel{?}{=}50-10\sqrt{22}-3</mrow>
            <mrow>47-10\sqrt{22}\amp\stackrel{\checkmark}{=}47-10\sqrt{22}</mrow>
        </md>
        </p></remark>
        <p>When the radicand from the quadratic formula (which is called the <term>discriminant</term><idx><h>discriminant</h></idx>) is a negative number, the quadratic equation has no real solution. <xref ref="example-quadratic-equation-no-solution">Example</xref> shows what happens in this case.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-quadratic-equation-no-solution">
            <statement>
                <p>Solve for <m>y</m> in <m>y^2-4y+8=0</m>.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>Identify that <m>\highlight{a=1}</m>, <m>\highlight{b=-4}</m> and <m>\highlight{c=8}</m>. We will substitute them into the quadratic formula:<md>

            <title>Pellet Trajectory Revisited</title>
            <statement>
                <p>Recall the example from <xref ref="section-properties-of-quadratic-functions"/>, we did an example where Yang measured the <xref ref="figure-shooting-distance" text="title">vertical distance that his pellets deviated</xref> from the cross-hairs at various distances to the target. A model for the distance that the pellet will rise or fall in inches, <m>y</m>, is given by <m>y=-0.005x^2+0.19x-0.9</m>, where <m>x</m> represents the distance to the target in yards. At what target distance will the pellet fall <m>6</m> inches from the reticule's aim?</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>First, start by setting up the equation. Since we know that the pellet will fall <m>6</m> inches, that means that <m>y=-6</m>. So our equation to solve is <m>-6=-0.005x^2+0.19x-0.9</m>. Since this isn't in standard form, we have to move the <m>-6</m> over to the other side.
                <md>
                    <mrow>-6\amp=-0.005x^2+0.19x-0.9</mrow>
                    <mrow>\addleft{6}-6\amp=-0.005x^2+0.19x-0.9\addright{6}</mrow>
                    <mrow>0\amp=-0.005x^2+0.19x+5.1</mrow>
                    <intertext>Next, we should assume that this doesn't factor nicely and go for the quadratic formula. In this case, <m>\highlight{a=-0.005}</m>, <m>\highlight{b=0.19}</m>, and <m>\highlight{c=5.1}</m>.</intertext>
                    <mrow>x\amp=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp=\frac{-0.19\pm\sqrt{0.19^2-4(-0.005)(5.1)}}{2(-0.005)}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp=\frac{-0.19\pm\sqrt{0.1381}}{-0.01}</mrow>
                </md></p>
                <p>This expression is in exact form, but this is scenario requires an approximation to be valuable. <me>x\approx-18.16 \text{ or } x\approx56.16</me>. The negative solution is meaningless in this case, so we should assume that the positive solution is the one for which we were looking. In conclusion, the pellet will have to travel about <m>56.16</m> yards before it falls <m>6</m> inches.</p>

        <title>Recognizing Linear and Quadratic Equations</title>

        <p>Now that we have solved both linear and quadratic equations, it is important to identify each type of equation. Recall that a <term>linear equation</term> has a degree of one and a <term>quadratic equation</term> has a degree of two. If there is any other operation on the variable such as division or a square root then it is not linear or quadratic. We can have other operations on numbers, but not the variables. Let's look at an example.</p>

        <title>Solving Linear and Quadratic Equations</title>

        <p>When an equation is <term>linear</term>, we move all variable terms to one side of the equation and all constant terms to the other side. Then we use division if needed to solve for the variable. This is outlined in <xref ref="list-solve-multistep-linear-equation">List</xref>.</p>

        <p>When an equation is <term>quadratic</term>, we have three different methods we can use. Here is an outline of the general process for determining which method to use.</p>

        <algorithm xml:id="algorithm-solving-linear-and-quadratic-equations"><idx><h>solving</h><h>linear and quadratic equations</h></idx>
            <title>Solving Quadratic Equations</title>
            <p><ol>
                <li><p>First, check whether there is a linear term, or whether there is only a squared expression and a constant. If there is only a squared expression and a constant, isolate the squared quantity and use the <term>square root method</term>.</p></li>
                <li><p>If there <em>is</em> a linear term, put the equation in <term>standard form</term> with all of the terms on one side and zero on the other side.
                    <ol>
                        <li><p>If the polynomial factors, solve the equation by <term>factoring</term>.</p></li>
                        <li><p>If the polynomial does not factor, use the <term>quadratic formula</term>.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                </p></li>
            </ol></p>

In this case, <m>a=m</m>, <m>b=n</m>, and <m>c=p.</m>  Thus, the solutions are<m>\frac{-n + \sqrt{n^{2}-4mp}}{2m}, \frac{-n - \sqrt{n^{2}-4mp}}{2m}</m>, or <m>\frac{-n \pm \sqrt{n^{2}-4mp}}{2m}</m>.
