    <introduction>
        <p>We've seen that a linear relationship can be expressed with an equation in <xref ref="equation-slope-intercept-form" text="title">slope-intercept form</xref> or with an equation in <xref ref="equation-point-slope-form" text="title">point-slope-form</xref>. There is a third standard form that you can use to write line equations. It's so <q>standard</q> that it's actually known as <term>standard form</term>.</p>

        <title>Standard Form Definition</title>

        <p>Imagine trying to gather donations to pay for a <m>\$10{,}000</m> medical procedure you cannot afford. Oversimplifying the mathematics a bit, suppose that there were only two types of donors in the world: those who will donate <m>\$20</m> and those who will donate <m>\$100</m>. How many of each, or what combination, do you need to reach the funding goal? As in, if <m>x</m> people donate <m>\$20</m> and <m>y</m> people donate <m>\$100</m>, what numbers could <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be? The donors of the first type have collectively donated <m>20x</m> dollars, and the donors of the second type have collectively donated <m>100y</m>. So altogether you'd need <me>20x+100y=10000\text{.}</me> This is an example of a line equation in <term>standard form</term>.</p>

            <statement>
                <p>It is always possible to write an equation for a line in the form <men xml:id="equation-standard-form">Ax+By=C</men> where <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> are three numbers (each of which might be <m>0</m>, although at least one of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must be nonzero). This form of a line equation is called <term>standard form</term>. In the context of an application, the meaning of <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> depends on that context. This equation is called <term>standard form</term> perhaps because <em>any</em> line can be written this way, even vertical lines which cannot be written using the two previous forms we've studied.<idx><h>standard form</h></idx><idx><h>form</h><h>standard</h></idx></p>

        </exercise>

        <p>Returning to the example with donations for the medical procedure, let's examine the equation <me>20x+100y=10000\text{.}</me> What units are attached to all of the parts of this equation? Both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are numbers of people. The <m>10000</m> is in dollars. Both the <m>20</m> and the <m>100</m> are in dollars per person. Note how both sides of the equation are in dollars. On the right, that fact is clear. On the left, <m>20x</m> is in dollars since <m>20</m> is in dollars per person, and <m>x</m> is in people. The same is true for <m>100y</m>, and the two dollar amounts <m>20x</m> and <m>100y</m> add to a dollar amount.</p>

        <p>What is the slope of the linear relationship? It's not immediately visible since <m>m</m> is not part of the standard form equation. But we can use algebra to isolate <m>y</m>:<md>
            <mrow>20x+100y\amp=10000</mrow>
            <mrow>100y\amp=\highlight{-20x}+10000</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp=\divideunder{-20x+10000}{100}</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp=\frac{-20x}{100}+\frac{10000}{100}</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp=-\frac{1}{5}x+100\text{.}</mrow>
        </md>And we see that the slope is <m>-\frac{1}{5}</m>. OK, what units are on that slope? As always, the units on slope are <m>\frac{y\text{-unit}}{x\text{-unit}}</m>. In this case that's <m>\frac{\text{person}}{\text{person}}</m>, which sounds a little weird and seems like it should be simplified away to unitless. But this slope of <m>-\frac{1}{5}\frac{\text{person}}{\text{person}}</m> is saying that for every one extra person who donates <m>\$20</m>, you only need <m>\frac{1}{5}</m> fewer people donating <m>\$100</m> to still reach your goal.</p>

        <p>What is the <m>y</m>-intercept? Since we've already converted the equation into slope-intercept form, we can see that it is at <m>(0,100)</m>. This tells us that if <m>0</m> people donate <m>\$20</m>, then you will need <m>100</m> people to each donate <m>\$100</m>.</p>

        <p>What does a graph for this line look like? We've already converted into slope-intercept form, and we could use that to make the graph. But when given a line in standard form, there is another approach that is often used. Returning to <me>20x+100y=10000\text{,}</me> let's calculate the <m>y</m>-intercept and the <m>x</m>-intercept. Recall that these are <em>points</em> where the line crosses the <m>y</m>-axis and <m>x</m>-axis. To be on the <m>y</m>-axis means that <m>x=0</m>, and to be on the <m>x</m>-axis means that <m>y=0</m>. All these zeros make the resulting algebra easy to solve:<md>
            <mrow>20x+100y\amp=10000\amp20x+100y\amp=10000</mrow>
            <mrow>20(\substitute{0})+100y\amp=10000\amp20x+100(\substitute{0})\amp=10000</mrow>
            <mrow>100y\amp=10000\amp20x\amp=10000</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp=\divideunder{10000}{100}\amp x\amp=\divideunder{10000}{20}</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp=100\amp x\amp=500</mrow>
        </md></p>

        <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">
            <p>So we have a <m>y</m>-intercept at <m>(0,100)</m> and an <m>x</m>-intercept at <m>(500,0)</m>. If we plot these, we get to mark especially relevant points given the context, and then drawing a straight line between them gives us <xref ref="figure-medical-procedure">Figure</xref>.</p>

    <subsection>
        <title>The <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-Intercepts</title>

        <p>With a linear relationship (and other types of equations), we are often interested in the <m>x</m>-intercept and <m>y</m>-intercept because they are important in the context. For example, in <xref ref="figure-medical-procedure">Figure</xref>, the <m>x</m>-intercept implies that if <em>no one</em> donates <m>\$100</m>, you need <m>500</m> people to donate <m>\$20</m> to get us to <m>\$10{,}000</m>.  And the <m>y</m>-intercept implies if <em>no one</em> donates <m>\$20</m>, you need <m>100</m> people to donate <m>\$100</m>. Let's look at another example.</p>

        <example>
            <p>James owns a restaurant that uses about <m>32</m> lb of flour every day. He just purchased <quantity><mag>1200</mag><unit base="pound" /></quantity> of flour. Model the amount of flour that remains <m>x</m> days later with a linear equation, and interpret the meaning of its <m>x</m>-intercept and <m>y</m>-intercept.</p>

            <p>Since the rate of change is constant (<quantity><mag>-32</mag><unit base="pound" /></quantity> every day), and we know the initial value, we can model the amount of flour at the restaurant with a <xref ref="equation-slope-intercept-form" text="title">slope-intercept equation</xref>: <me>y=-32x+1200</me> where <m>x</m> represents the number of days passed since the initial purchase, and <m>y</m> represents the amount of flour left (in <quantity><unit base="pound" /></quantity>.)</p>

            <p>A line's <m>x</m>-intercept is in the form of <m>(x,0)</m>, since to be on the <m>x</m>-axis, the <m>y</m>-coordinate must be <m>0</m>. To find this line's <m>x</m>-intercept, we substitute <m>y</m> in the equation with <m>0</m>, and solve for <m>x\text{:}</m>

            <md>
                <mrow>y\amp=-32x+1200</mrow>
                <mrow>\substitute{0}\amp=-32x+1200</mrow>
                <mrow>0\subtractright{1200}\amp=-32x</mrow>
                <mrow>-1200\amp=-32x</mrow>
                <mrow>\divideunder{-1200}{-32}\amp=x</mrow>
                <mrow>37.5\amp=x</mrow>
            </md></p>

            <p>So the line's <m>x</m>-intercept is at <m>(37.5,0)\text{.}</m> In context this means the flour would last for <m>37.5</m> days.</p>

            <p>A line's <m>y</m>-intercept is in the form of <m>(0,y)\text{.}</m> This line equation is already in slope-intercept form, so we can just see that its <m>y</m>-intercept is at <m>(0,1200)</m>. In general though, we would substitute <m>x</m> in the equation with <m>0\text{,}</m> and we have:

            <md>
                <mrow>y\amp=-32x+1200</mrow>
                <mrow>y\amp=-32(\substitute{0})+1200</mrow>
                <mrow>y\amp=1200</mrow>
            </md></p>

            <p>So yes, the line's <m>y</m>-intercept is at <m>(0,1200)\text{.}</m> This means that when the flour was purchased, there was <quantity><mag>1200</mag><unit base="pound" /></quantity> of it. In other words, the <m>y</m>-intercept tells us one of the original pieces of information: in the beginning, James purchased <quantity><mag>1200</mag><unit base="pound" /></quantity> of flour.</p>

        </example>

        <p>If a line is in standard form, it's often easiest to graph it using its two intercepts.</p>


        <example xml:id="example-graph-by-intercepts">
            <statement>
                <p>Graph <m>2x-3y=-6</m> using its intercepts. And then use the intercepts to calculate the line's slope.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>To graph a line by its <m>x</m>-intercept and <m>y</m>-intercept, it might help to first set up a table like <xref ref="table-intercepts">Table</xref>:</p>

                <p>A table like this might help you stay focused on the fact that we are searching for <em>two</em> points. As we've noted earlier, an <m>x</m>-intercept is on the <m>x</m>-axis, and so its <m>y</m>-coordinate must be <m>0</m>. This is worth taking special note of: to find an <m>x</m>-intercept, <m>y</m> must be <m>0</m>. This is why we put <m>0</m> in the <m>y</m>-value cell of the <m>x</m>-intercept. Similarly, a line's <m>y</m>-intercept has <m>x=0</m>, and we put <m>0</m> into the <m>x</m>-value cell of the <m>y</m>-intercept.</p>

                <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">

                    <p>Next, we calculate the line's <m>x</m>-intercept by substituting <m>y=0</m> into the equation<md>
                        <mrow>2x-3y\amp=-6</mrow>

                        <mrow>x\amp=-3</mrow>
                    </md>So the line's <m>x</m>-intercept is <m>(-3,0)\text{.}</m></p>

                    <p>Similarly, we substitute <m>x=0</m> into the equation to calculate the <m>y</m>-intercept:<md>
                        <mrow>2x-3y\amp=-6</mrow>
                        <mrow>2(\substitute{0})-3y\amp=-6</mrow>

                        <mrow>y\amp=2</mrow>
                    </md>So the line's <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,2)</m>.</p>

        <title>Transforming between Standard Form and Slope-Intercept Form</title>

        <p>Sometimes a linear equation arises in <xref ref="equation-standard-form" text="title">standard form</xref>, but it would be useful to see that equation in <xref ref="equation-slope-intercept-form" text="title">slope-intercept form</xref>. Or perhaps, vice versa.</p>

        <p>A linear equation in <xref ref="equation-slope-intercept-form" text="title">slope-intercept form</xref> tells us important information about the line: its slope <m>m</m> and <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0,b)\text{.}</m> However, a line's standard form does not show those two important values. As a result, we often need to change a line's equation from standard form to slope-intercept form. Let's look at some examples.</p>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>Change <m>2x-3y=-6</m> to slope-intercept form, and then graph it.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>Since a line in slope-intercept form looks like <m>y=\ldots</m>, we will solve for <m>y</m> in <m>2x-3y=-6\text{:}</m></p>

                    </md></p>

                    <p>In the third line, we wrote <m>-2x-6</m> on the right side, instead of <m>-6-2x\text{.}</m> The only reason we did this is because we are headed to slope-intercept form, where the <m>x</m>-term is traditionally written first.</p>

                        <p>Compare this graphing method with the Graphing by Intercepts method in <xref ref="example-graph-by-intercepts">Example</xref>. We have more points in this graph, thus we can graph the line more accurately.</p>

                <p>First, we will try (and fail) to graph this line using its <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-intercepts.</p>

                <p>Trying to find the <m>x</m>-intercept:<md>

                    <mrow>x\amp=0</mrow>
                </md>So the line's <m>x</m>-intercept is at <m>(0,0)\text{,}</m> at the origin.</p>

                <p>Huh, that is <em>also</em> on the <m>y</m>-axis<ellipsis /></p>

                <p>Trying to find the <m>y</m>-intercept:<md>

                    <mrow>y\amp=0</mrow>
                </md>So the line's <m>y</m>-intercept is also at <m>(0,0)</m>.</p>

                <p>Since both intercepts are the same point, there is no way to use the intercepts alone to graph this line. So what can be done?</p>
