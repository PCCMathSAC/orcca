    <introduction>
        <p>With the skills we have learned for solving one-step linear equations, we can solve a variety of percent-related problems that arise in our everyday life.</p>

        <figure>
            <caption>Alternative Video Lesson</caption>
            <video youtube="LkTYkHbUiU4"/>
        </figure>

        <p>In many situations when translating from English to math, the word <q>of</q> translates as multiplication. For example:<md>
            <mrow>\text{One third }\amp\text{of thirty is ten.}</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{1}{3}\amp\cdot30=10</mrow>
        </md>It's also helpful to note that when we translate English into math, the word <q>is</q> (and many similar words related to <q>to be</q>) translates to an equals sign.</p>

        <p>Here is another example, this time involving a percentage. We know that <q><m>2</m> is <m>50\%</m> of <m>4</m>,</q> so we have:<md>
            <mrow>2\amp\text{ is } 50\% \text{ of } 4</mrow>
            <mrow>2\amp= 0.5\cdot4</mrow>
        </md></p>

        <example xml:id="example-translate-percent-statement-to-equation">
            <statement>
                <p>Translate each statement involving percents below into an equation. Define any variables used. (Solving these equations is an exercise).<ol label="a.">
                    <li>
                        <p>How much is <m>30\%</m> of <m>\$24.00</m>?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><m>\$7.20</m> is what percent of <m>\$24.00</m>?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><m>\$7.20</m> is <m>30\%</m> of how much money?</p>
                    </li>
                </ol></p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>Each question can be translated from English into a math equation by reading it slowly and looking for the right signals.<ol label="a.">
                    <li>
                        <p>The word <q>is</q> means about the same thing as the <m>=</m> sign. <q>How much</q> is a question phrase, and we can let <m>x</m> be the unknown amount (in dollars). The word <q>of</q> translates to multiplication, as discussed earlier. So we have:<me>\underbrace{\strut x}_{\text{How much}}\underbrace{\strut =}_{\text{is}}\underbrace{\strut 0.30}_{\text{30}\%}\underbrace{\strut\cdot}_{\text{of}}\underbrace{\strut 24}_{\text{\$24}}</me></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Let <m>P</m> be the unknown value. We have:<me>\underbrace{\strut 7.2}_{\text{\$7.20}}\underbrace{\strut =}_{\text{is}}\underbrace{\strut P}_{\text{what percent}}\underbrace{\strut\cdot}_{\text{of}}\underbrace{\strut 24}_{\text{\$24}}</me>With this setup, <m>P</m> is going to be a decimal value (<m>0.30</m>) that you would translate into a percentage (<m>30\%</m>).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Let <m>x</m> be the unknown amount (in dollars). We have:<me>\underbrace{\strut 7.2}_{\text{\$7.20}}\underbrace{\strut =}_{\text{is}}\underbrace{\strut 0.30}_{\text{30}\%}\underbrace{\strut\cdot}_{\text{of}}\underbrace{\strut x}_{\text{how much money}}</me></p>

    <subsection>
        <title>Modeling and Solving Percent Equations</title>

        <p>An important skill for solving percent-related problems is to boil down a complicated word problem into a simple form like <q><m>2</m> is <m>50\%</m> of <m>4</m>.</q> Let's look at some further examples.</p>

        <remark>
            <p>When solving problems that are <em>not</em> applications, we state the <term>solution set</term><idx><h>solution set</h></idx>. This communicates the set of all solution(s) to that equation or inequality. However, when solving an equation or inequality that arises in an application problem, it makes more sense to summarize our result with a sentence, using the context of the application. This allows us to communicate the full result, including appropriate units.</p>
        </remark>

            <statement>

                    <p>As of Fall 2016, Portland Community College had <m>89{,}900</m> enrolled students. According to the chart below, how many black students were enrolled at PCC as of Fall 2016 term?</p>

                <p>Be careful that you do not calculate <m>28\%</m> of <m>\$2200</m>. That might be what a student would do who fails to read the question repeatedly. If you have ever trained yourself to quickly find numbers in word problems and substitute them into formulas, you must <em>unlearn</em> this. The issue is that <m>\$2200</m> is not the dealership's sales profit, and if you mistakenly multiply <m>0.28\cdot2200=616</m>, then <m>\$616</m> makes no sense as an answer to this question. How could Kandace bring in only <m>\$616</m> of sales profit, and be rewarded with <m>\$2200</m> in commission?</p>

        <p>In the following price increase/decrease problems, the key is to identify the original price, which represents <m>100\%</m>. For these problems, it is important to note that <q>a percent <em>of</em></q> and <q>a percent <em>off</em></q> are two very different things. To find <m>10\%</m> <em>of</em> <m>\$50</m>, simply multiply the percentage with the number: <m>0.10\cdot\$50=\$5</m>. So, <m>\$5</m> is <m>10\%</m> of <m>\$50</m>. To find <m>10\%</m> <em>off</em> from an original value of <m>\$50</m>, consider how if we took <m>10\%</m> off, we would only need to pay <m>90\%</m> of the original value. This means to find <m>10\%</m> off, multiply the <m>90\%</m> with the number: <m>0.90\cdot\$50=\$45</m>. So, <m>\$45</m> is <m>10\%</m> off from <m>\$50</m>.</p>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>A shirt is on sale with <m>15\%</m> off. The current price is <m>\$51.00</m>. What was the original price?</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>If the shirt was <m>15\%</m> off, then what you pay for it is <m>100\%-15\%</m>, or <m>85\%</m>, of its original price. So we can translate this problem into <q><m>51</m> is <m>85\%</m> of what?</q> It's very important to note that we are using <m>85\%</m>, not <m>15\%</m>. Let <m>x</m> represent the shirt's original price, in dollars.  We can set up and solve the equation:<md>
                    <mrow>51\amp=0.85\cdot x</mrow>
                    <mrow>\divideunder{51}{0.85}\amp=\divideunder{0.85x}{0.85}</mrow>

                    <p>A full tank of gas will now cost <var name="$cost" width="10" />.</p>
                </statement>
                <solution>
                    <p>After a <m>12\%</m> increase, the new cost would be <m>100\%+12\%=112\%</m> of the original price. We can translate this problem into <q>what is <m>112\%</m> of <m>40</m>?</q>. Let <m>x</m> represent the new price in dollars. We can set up and solve the equation:<md>
                        <mrow>x\amp=1.12\cdot40</mrow>
                        <mrow>x\amp=44.8</mrow>
                    </md></p>

                    <p>A full tank now costs <m>\$44.80</m>.</p>
                </solution>
            </webwork>
        </exercise>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>Enrollment at your neighborhood's elementary school two years ago was <m>417</m> children. After a <m>15\%</m> increase last year and a <m>15\%</m> decrease this year, what's the new enrollment?</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>It is tempting to think that increasing by <m>15\%</m> and then decreasing by <m>15\%</m> would bring the enrollment right back to where it started. But the <m>15\%</m> decrease applies to the enrollment <em>after</em> it had already increased. So that <m>15\%</m> decrease is going to translate to <em>more</em> students lost than were gained.</p>

                <p>Using <m>100\%</m> as corresponding to the enrollment from two years ago, the enrollment last year was <m>100\%+15\%=115\%</m> of that. But then using <m>100\%</m> as corresponding to the enrollment from last year, the enrollment this year was <m>100\%-15\%=85\%</m> of that. So we can set up and solve the equation<md>
                    <mrow>\overbrace{\strut x}^{\text{this year's enrollment}}\amp\overbrace{\strut =}^{\text{is}}\overbrace{\strut 0.85}^{85\%}\overbrace{\strut \cdot}^{\text{of}}\overbrace{\strut 1.15}^{115\%}\overbrace{\strut \cdot}^{\text{of}}\overbrace{\strut 417}^{\text{enrollment two years ago}}</mrow>
                    <mrow>x\amp=0.85\cdot1.15\cdot417</mrow>
                    <mrow>x\amp=407.6175</mrow>
                </md></p>

                <p>We would round and report that enrollment is now <m>408</m> students. (The percentage rise and fall of <m>15\%</m> were probably rounded in the first place, which is why we did not end up with a whole number of children.)</p>
            </solution>
