  <title>Systems of Two Linear Equations Chapter Review</title>
  <assemblage>
    <title>Solving a System by Graphing</title>
    <p>
      A <term>system of two linear equations in two variables</term> (or <q>system</q> for short) is
      a collection of two linear equations, each using the same two variables. A system is often
      presented like:
      <me>
        \left\{
          \begin{alignedat}{4}
            Ax \amp {}+{} \amp By \amp {}={} \amp C \\
            Dx \amp {}+{} \amp Ey \amp {}={} \amp F
          \end{alignedat}
        \right.
      </me>
      but the two equations do not need to be in standard form like the two equations above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Systems of two linear equations in two variables arise in applications where, of course, there
      are two unknown quantities. But also there is some background information that lets you
      logically put together two ways that the variables must relate to each other. See
      <xref ref="example-fabiana-and-david-graph"/> and
      <xref ref="exercise-solve-system-application"/> for some examples.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <term>solution</term> to a system is an ordered pair of numbers that can be substituted in
      to the two equations for the two variables, and make <em>both</em> equations true (not just
      one or the other). It turns out that a system of two linear equations in two variables will
      always have either exactly one solution, no solutions at all, or infinitely many solutions
      that all lie along one straight line.
    </p>
    <p>
      One method to find the solution(s) to a system is to graph the two lines. Most of the time,
      the lines cross sat one point, and this one point <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> is the only solution to the
      system. If you graph precisely and accurately, then you can discern the coordinates of this
      crossing point and you know the solution to the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Graphing might reveal that the two lines are parallel and never cross. Then you have an
      <term>inconsistent</term> system, and there is no solution. Or you might find that the
      <q>two</q> lines are actually the same line. This means you have a <term>dependent</term>
      system and there are infinitely many solutions (which are all the points along that common
      line).
    </p>

    <title>Substitution</title>
    <p>
      One alternative technique to solve a system of two linear equations in two variables is called
      <term>substitution</term>. With this technique, you choose one of the variables from one of
      the equations and isolate that variable. Then <q>substitute</q> that expression in for this
      variable in the <em>other</em> equation. Most of the time this leaves you with one equation
      in only one variable, so you can use skills from
      <xref ref="chapter-linear-equations-and-inequalities"/> to solve for that one remaining
      variable. With one of the variables solved for, it's not much more work to solve for the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      If either of the equations can be simplified (for example by distributing, by combining like
      terms, or by scaling all terms to clear denominators) then you should do that as a first step.
      If there are like terms on opposite sides, you should use algebra to combine them together on
      one side. Then it is wise to identify which of the four instances of a variable (among the two
      equations) has the simplest coefficient, and choose that variable as the one to isolate. For
      example if any of the variables have <m>1</m> or <m>-1</m> as their coefficient, then you can
      isolate that variable without using division, and without potentially bringing more fractions
      into the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may find that after you make a substitution and simplify, <em>both</em> of the variables
      disappear instead of just one. When this happens, you either had an inconsistent system (with
      no solution) or a dependent system (with infinitely many solutions). If the equation you now
      have is an outright false equation (like <m>0=1</m>) then you had an inconsistent system. If
      it is an outright true equation (like <m>2=2</m>) then you had a dependent system.

  <assemblage>
    <title>Elimination</title>
    <p>
      Yet another option for solving a system of two equations in two variables is to use the
      <term>elimination</term> method, also known as the <term>addition</term> method. With this
      technique you cleverly scale one or both equations so that terms that go along with one of the
      variables have opposite coefficients. Then you can add the left sides together and the right
      sides together, and the resulting equation only has one variable. From there it is easy to
      solve for that one variable, and then use that solution to solve for the other variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as with the substitution method, it is wise to begin by simplifying the equations if they
      can be simplified. And scaling the equations just to clear denominators or decimal points.
      Furthermore, since you will be adding terms from different equations, it is wise to covert
      each equation into standard form so that the corresponding terms are aligned.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may find that after you add to equations to eliminate a variable that <em>both</em> of the
      variables have been eliminated. When this happens, you either had an inconsistent system (with
      no solution) or a dependent system (with infinitely many solutions). If the equation you now
      have is an outright false equation (like <m>0=1</m>) then you had an inconsistent system. If
      it is an outright true equation (like <m>2=2</m>) then you had a dependent system.
