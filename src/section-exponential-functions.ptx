    <title>Exponential Functions</title>

   <subsection><title>Graph Exponential Functions</title>

<p>The functions we have studied so far do not give us a model for many naturally occurring phenomena. From the growth of populations and the spread of viruses to radioactive decay and compounding interest, the models are very different from what we have studied so far. These models involve exponential functions.</p>

<statement><p>An <term>exponential function</term>, where <m>b&gt;0</m> and <m>b\ne 1,</m> is a function of the form<me>f\left(x\right)={b}^{x}</me></p></statement></definition>

<p>Notice that in this function, the variable is the exponent. In our functions so far, the variables were the base.</p>

<description>A comparison of a linear function, a quadratic function, and an exponential function, with arrows pointing to the variable, x.</description></image>
</figure>

<p>Our definition says <m>b\ne 1.</m> If we let <m>b=1,</m> then <m>f\left(x\right)={b}^{x}</m> becomes <m>f\left(x\right)={1}^{x}.</m> Since <m>{1}^{x}=1</m> for all real numbers, <m>f\left(x\right)={1}^{}.</m> This is the constant function.</p>

<p>Our definition also says <m>b&gt;0.</m> If we let a base be negative, say <m>-4,</m> then <m>f\left(x\right)={\left(-4\right)}^{x}</m> is not a real number when <m>x=\frac{1}{2}</m>:

<me>\begin{array}{cccc}\hfill f\left(x\right)&amp; =\hfill &amp; {\left(-4\right)}^{x}\hfill \\ \hfill f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)&amp; =\hfill &amp; {\left(-4\right)}^{\frac{1}{2}}\hfill \\ \hfill f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)&amp; =\hfill &amp; \sqrt{-4}\hfill&amp; \text{not a real number} \end{array}</me>

In fact, <m>f\left(x\right)={\left(-4\right)}^{x}</m> would not be a real number any time <m>x</m> is a fraction with an even denominator. So our definition requires <m>b&gt;0.</m></p>

<p>By graphing a few exponential functions, we will be able to see their unique properties.</p>

</solution></exercise>

<p>If we look at the graphs from the previous examples, we can identify some of the properties of exponential functions.</p>

<p>The graphs of <m>f\left(x\right)={2}^{x}</m> and <m>g\left(x\right)={3}^{x}</m>, as well as the graphs of <m>f\left(x\right)={4}^{x}</m> and <m>g\left(x\right)={5}^{x}</m>, all have the same basic shape. This is the shape we expect from an exponential function where <m>b&gt;1</m>.</p>

<p>We notice, that for each function, the graph contains the point <m>\left(0,1\right).</m> This makes sense because <m>{b}^{0}=1</m> for any <m>b&gt;1</m>.</p>

<p>The graph of each function, <m>f\left(x\right)={b}^{x}</m> also contains the point <m>\left(1,b\right).</m> The graph of <m>f\left(x\right)={2}^{x}</m> contains <m>\left(1,2\right)</m> and the graph of <m>g\left(x\right)={3}^{x}</m> contains <m>\left(1,3\right).</m> This makes sense as <m>{b}^{1}=b</m> for any <m>b&gt;1</m>.</p>

<p>Notice too, that the graph of each function <m>f\left(x\right)={b}^{x}</m> also contains the point <m>\left(-1,\frac{1}{b}\right).</m> The graph of <m>f\left(x\right)={2}^{x}</m> contains <m>\left(-1,\frac{1}{2}\right)</m> and the graph of <m>g\left(x\right)={3}^{x}</m> contains <m>\left(-1,\frac{1}{3}\right).</m> This makes sense as <m>{b}^{-1}=\frac{1}{b}</m> for any <m>b&gt;1</m>.</p>

<p>What is the domain for each function? From the graphs we can see that the domain is the set of all real numbers. There is no restriction on the domain. We write the domain in interval notation as <m>(-\infty ,\infty)</m>.</p>

<p>Look at each graph. What is the range of the function? Notice that the graph is always above and never touches the <m>x</m>-axis. Thus, the range is all positive numbers. We write the range in interval notation as <m>\left(0,\infty \right).</m></p>

<p>Whenever a graph of a function approaches a line but never touches it, we call that line an <term>asymptote</term>. For the exponential functions we are looking at, the graph approaches the <m>x</m>-axis very closely but will never cross it. So we call the line <m>y=0,</m> the <m>x</m>-axis, a horizontal asymptote.</p>

<p>We summarize these results below.

<p>Our definition of an exponential function <m>f\left(x\right)={b}^{x}</m> says <m>b&gt;0,</m> but the examples and discussion so far has been about functions where <m>b&gt;1.</m> What happens when <m>0&lt;b&lt;1</m>? The next example will explore this possibility.</p>

        </solution></exercise>


<p>Now let's look at the graphs from the previous examples, so we can now identify some of the properties of exponential functions where <m>0&lt;b&lt;1.</m></p>

<p>The graphs of <m>f\left(x\right)={\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}^{x}</m> and <m>g\left(x\right)={\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)}^{x}</m> as well as the graphs of <m>f\left(x\right)={\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)}^{x}</m> and <m>g\left(x\right)={\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)}^{x}</m> all have the same basic shape. While this is the shape we expect from an exponential function, the graphs go down from left to right (i.e. they're decreasing), while the previous graphs, when <m>b&gt;1,</m> went from up from left to right (i.e. they're increasing).</p>

<p>We notice that for each function, the graph still contains the point (0, 1). This should make sense because <m>{b}^{0}=1</m> for any <m>b&gt;0</m>.</p>

<p>As before, the graph of each function, <m>f\left(x\right)={b}^{x},</m> also contains the point <m>\left(1,b\right).</m> The graph of <m>f\left(x\right)={\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}^{x}</m> contains <m>\left(1,\frac{1}{2}\right)</m> and the graph of <m>g\left(x\right)={\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)}^{x}</m> contains <m>\left(1,\frac{1}{3}\right).</m> This makes sense as <m>{b}^{1}=b</m> for any <m>b</m>.</p>

<p>Notice too that the graph of each function, <m>f\left(x\right)={b}^{x},</m> also contains the point <m>\left(-1,\frac{1}{b}\right).</m> The graph of <m>f\left(x\right)={\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}^{x}</m> contains <m>\left(-1,2\right)</m> and the graph of <m>g\left(x\right)={\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)}^{x}</m> contains <m>\left(-1,3\right).</m> This makes sense as <m>{b}^{-1}=\frac{1}{b}</m> for any <m>b&gt;0</m>.</p>

<p>What is the domain and range for each function? From the graphs we can see that the domain is the set of all real numbers and we write the domain in interval notation as <m>\left(-\infty ,\infty \right).</m> Again, the graph is always above and never touches the <m>x</m>-axis. Thus, the range is the set of all positive numbers. We write the range in interval notation as <m>\left(0,\infty \right).</m></p>

<p>We will summarize these properties in <xref ref="table-properties-of-graph-exponential-function-with-base-greater-than-zero">Table</xref>, which also includes when <m>b&gt;1.</m></p>

<p>All of our exponential functions so far have had either an integer or a rational number as the base. We will now look at an exponential function with an irrational number as the base.</p>

<p>Before we can look at this exponential function, we need to define the irrational number, <m>e</m>. This number is used as a base in many applications in the sciences and business that are modeled by exponential functions. The number is defined as the value of <m>{\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)}^{n}</m> as <m>n</m> gets larger and larger. We say, as <m>n</m> approaches infinity, or increases without bound. The table shows the value of <m>{\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)}^{n}</m> for several values of <m>n</m>.

<subsection ><title>Use Exponential Models in Applications</title>

<p>Exponential functions model many situations. If you own a bank account, you have experienced the use of an exponential function, which is used to calculate compound interest. If you've worked in a laboratory with bacteria, then you are familiar with the exponential growth of bacteria, which can be modeled by an exponential function.</p>

<paragraphs>

<title>Compound Interest</title>

<introduction><p>There are two formulas that are used to determine the balance in the account when interest is earned. If a principal, <m>P</m>, is invested at an interest rate, <m>r</m> (in decimal form), for <m>t</m> years, the new balance, <m>A</m>, will depend on how often the interest is compounded. If the interest is compounded <m>n</m> times a year we use the formula <m>A=P\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}.</m> If the interest is compounded continuously, we use the formula <m>A=P{e}^{rt}.</m> These are the formulas for <term>compound interest</term>.</p></introduction>


<p>For a principal, <m>P</m>, invested at an interest rate, <m>r</m> (in decimal form), for <m>t</m> years, the new balance, <m>A</m>, is:</p>
<p><md>
    <mrow>A=P\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}\amp \text{when compounded } n \text{ times a year.}</mrow>
    <mrow>A=P{e}^{rt}\amp  \text{when compounded continuously.}</mrow>

<p>As you work with the interest formulas, it is often helpful to identify the values of the variables first and then substitute them into the formula.</p>

<example><statement><p>A total of <m>\$10{,}000</m> was invested in a college fund for a new grandchild. If the interest rate is <m>5\%</m>, how much will be in the account in <m>18</m> years by each method of compounding?</p>

<title>Exponential Growth and Decay</title>

<introduction><p>Other topics that are modeled by exponential functions involve growth and decay. Both also use the formula <m>A=P{e}^{rt}</m> we used for the growth of money. For growth and decay, generally we use <m>{A}_{0}</m>, as the original amount instead of calling it <m>P,</m> the principal. We see that <term>exponential growth</term> has a positive rate of growth and <term>exponential decay</term> has a negative rate of growth.</p></introduction>

<p>For an original amount, <m>{A}_{0}</m>, that grows or decays at a rate, <m>r</m>, for a certain time, <m>t</m>, the final amount, <m>A</m>, is:

<me>A={A}_{0}{e}^{rt}</me></p>

<p>Exponential growth is typically seen in the growth of populations of humans or animals or bacteria. Our next example looks at the growth of a virus.</p>


<example>
    <statement>
        <p>Chris is a researcher at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and he is trying to understand the behavior of a new and dangerous virus. He starts his experiment with <m>100</m> of the virus that grows at a rate of <m>25\%</m> per hour. He will check on the virus in <m>24</m> hours. How many viruses will he find?</p></statement>
