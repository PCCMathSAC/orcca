    <title>Graphing Lines by Plotting Points</title>
    <p>
      Sometimes, the easiest way to make a graph of an equation is by making a table and plotting points.
      (This was the approach in <xref ref="section-graphing-equations">Section</xref>.)
      Let's refresh ourselves on how this works.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example-tub-drain-introduction">
      <p>
        A bathtub is holding <m>12</m> gallons of water.
        The drain starts to leak water at a constant rate of <m>0.6</m> gallons per second.
        A linear function with formula <m>W(x)=-0.6x+12</m> can be used to model the amount of water, in gallons,
        in the tub <m>x</m> seconds after it started draining.
        Let's make a graph of this function.
        The most straightforward method to graph any function is to build a table of <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-values,
        and then plot the points.

            Could we have made a more helpful table? Maybe.
            The <m>y</m>-values are close together
            and for the most part they are decimals which can be difficult to plot accurately.
            No matter, for now we use these points and make a plot.
            <!-- Perhaps we should have chosen <m>x</m>-values
            that would have resulted in <xref ref="item-integer-definition" text="custom">integer</xref> <m>y</m>-values.
            To do that, we would have needed to investigate the equation more carefully and have chosen <m>x</m>-values
            that were multiples of <m>5</m>.
            We will essentially do this in <xref ref="example-tub-drain-with-slope-intercept-form">Example</xref>. -->
          </p>
          <p>
            The advantage of plotting points is that it is a universal method to graph any function.
            It is easy to forget about this method after learning faster ways to graph functions,
            so to keep this method in your mathematical tool box in case you come across something
            that you don't know or remember how to graph.

    <title>Graphing Lines in Slope-Intercept Form</title>
    <p>
      Recall that the <xref ref="equation-slope-intercept-form" text="custom">slope-intercept form</xref>
      of a line equation is <m>y=mx+b</m> where <m>m</m> is the slope and <m>(0,b)</m> is the vertical intercept.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example-tub-drain-with-slope-intercept-form">
      <p>
        An efficient method to graph <m>y=-0.6x+12</m> is to use the fact that it is in slope-intercept form.
        To quickly make a graph, examine the equation and pick out the slope (in this case <m>-0.6</m>)
        and vertical intercept (in this case <m>(0,12)</m>),
        and then plot slope-triangles from the intercept to locate more points on the line.
        One key point here is that it helps to have the <xref ref="definition-slope" text="custom">slope</xref>
        written as a fraction. In this case, <me>-0.6=-\frac{6}{10}=-\frac{3}{5}</me>.
        So start our graph at <m>(0,12)</m> and go forward <m>5</m> units and then down <m>3</m> units to reach more points.
      </p>
      <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">
        <p>
           Since we know that we will go forward <m>5</m> units and then down <m>3</m> units,
           and that we will start our graph at <m>(0,12)</m>,
           we can choose to orient and scale our axes to see a more complete picture of <m>W</m>
           than we achieved by plotting convenient points in <xref ref="example-tub-drain-introduction">Example</xref>.

    <title>Graphing Lines in Point-Slope Form</title>
    <p>
      Recall that the <xref ref="equation-point-slope-form" text="custom">point-slope form</xref> of a line equation
      is <m>y=m(x-x_0)+y_0</m> where <m>m</m> is the slope and <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> is a point on the line.
      The reason that <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> is a point on the line is because you can substitute in <m>x_0</m> for <m>x</m>
      and then <m>y_0</m> is the result for <m>y</m>.
      <me>
        \underset{\overset{\downarrow}{y_0}}{\strut y \strut}=m(\overset{\overset{x_0}{\downarrow}}{\strut x \strut}-x_0)+y_0
      </me>
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        The population of Monarch butterflies has been on
        <url href="https://www.fws.gov/midwest/monarch/OverwinteringMonarchs.html" visual="www.fws.gov/midwest/monarch/OverwinteringMonarchs.html">an overall downward trajectory</url>
        since the 1980s, as have populations of many migratory animals.
        Efforts to restore the population haven't had great success yet.
        There are several distinct populations of Monarchs that probably never meet each other:
        the Hawaii population, the Florida Keys population, the Western population, and the Eastern population.
        Of these, the Eastern population is by far the largest
        and we can model this population of Monarch butterflies with a simple linear function.
        <me>M(x)=-(x-2006)+15</me>
        approximates the total number of acres of Mexican forest that the Eastern population of Monarchs hibernates in
        during winter in year <m>x</m>.
        This formula is only valid from 1995 to 2018, the years that the population has been well studied.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's make graph of this equation given the information provided, but only between 1995 and 2018.
      </p>
      <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">
        <stack>
          <p>
            Since this formula is linear and given in point-slope form,
            we can easily read that the slope of the line is <m>-1</m>,
            and the point given by the equation is <m>(2006,15)</m>.
            This means that we should scale our graph appropriately to be able to see these details.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can interpret the point <m>(2006,15)</m> to mean that in the year 2006,
            the Monarchs overwintered in <m>15</m> acres of Mexican forest.
            The slope means that for every one year that goes by,
            the overwintering population takes up about one less acre of forest.

        This is not only <m>100</m> times the size of the peak population in the 1980s,
        but the Purépecha of central Mexico were not conducting scientific surveys (that we know of)
        to count the butterflies in the year 0.

    <title>Graphing Lines Using Intercepts</title>
    <p>
      Recall that the <xref ref="equation-standard-form" text="custom">standard form</xref> of a line equation
      is <m>Ax+By=C</m> where where <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> are three numbers
      (each of which might be <m>0</m>, although at least one of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must be nonzero).
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
        Recall our bathtub draining problem from <xref ref="example-tub-drain-introduction">Example</xref>,
        where <m>W(x)=-0.6x+12</m> modeled the amount of water, in gallons,
        in the tub <m>x</m> seconds after it started draining.
        Let's write the line equation <m>y=-0.6x+12</m> in standard form.
      </p>
      <p>
        To find the standard form of the equation,
        we do as in <xref ref="subsection-transforming-between-standard-form-and-slope-intercept-form">Subsection</xref>.
        First, we will replace the variable <m>W(x)</m> with <m>y</m>
        because standard form relates <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> and does not use function notation.
        So <m>W(x)=-0.6x+12</m> becomes <m>y=-0.6x+12</m>.
        Now to convert to standard form, move both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> to the left-hand side.
        <!-- We also find it convenient to write the decimal as a fraction and clear the denominator. -->
        <md>
          <mrow>y\amp=-0.6x+12</mrow>
          <mrow>0.6x+y\amp=12</mrow>
          <!-- <mrow>\frac{3}{5}x+y\amp=12</mrow> -->
          <!-- <mrow>\multiplyleft{5}\left(\frac{3}{5}x+y\right)\amp=\multiplyleft{5}12</mrow> -->
          <!-- <mrow>3x+5y\amp=60</mrow> -->
        </md>
        The equation is in standard form written as <m>0.6x+y=12</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p>
      If a linear function is given in standard form,
      we can relative easily find the equation's <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-intercepts
      by substituting in <m>y=0</m> and <m>x=0</m>, respectively.
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
         Let's find the intercepts of <m>0.6x+y=12</m>,
         still relating back to <xref ref="example-tub-drain-introduction">Example</xref>.
         Then we may graph the equation using those intercepts.
      </p>
      <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">
        <p>
          To find the <m>x</m>-intercept, set <m>y=0</m> and solve for <m>x</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow>0.6x+\substitute{(0)}\amp=12</mrow>

            <mrow>x\amp=20</mrow>
          </md>
          So the <m>x</m>-intercept is the point <m>(\firsthighlight{20},\secondhighlight{0})</m>.
          In context, this means that <m>\firsthighlight{20}</m> minutes after the tub started to drain,
          <m>\secondhighlight{0}</m> gallons of water remained. This is telling us that the tub is empty!
        </p>
        <p>
          To find the <m>y</m>-intercept, set <m>x=0</m> and solve for <m>y</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow>0.6\substitute{(0)}+y\amp=12</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp=12</mrow>
          </md>
          So, the <m>y</m>-intercept is the point <m>(\firsthighlight{0},\secondhighlight{12})</m>.
          In context, this means that <m>\firsthighlight{0}</m> minutes after the tub started to drain,
          <m>\secondhighlight{12}</m> gallons of water remained.
          This is telling us how much water was initially in the tub.

      <p>
        When you sketch the graph of a straight line on paper using a straight edge,
        even having the straight edge off by a very small angle can have a large effect on where the line is drawn,
        and make your sketch too inaccurate for many purposes.
        To protect against this, you can find a third point on the line.
        To that end, we choose <m>x=5</m>, then solve for <m>y</m> in the given equation.
        <md>
          <mrow>0.6(\substitute{5})+y\amp=12</mrow>
          <mrow>3+y\amp=12</mrow>
          <mrow>y\amp=9</mrow>
        </md>
        Note we chose <m>x=5</m> because it would end up with an integer for <m>y</m>.
        So another point on the line must be <m>(\firsthighlight{5},\secondhighlight{9})</m>.
        In context, this means that <m>\firsthighlight{5}</m> minutes after the tub started to drain,
        <m>\secondhighlight{9}</m> gallons of water remained.

          Now with the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-intercepts known along with an additional point,
          we may plot these points and draw the line that runs through them.

    <title>Graphing Functions by Plotting Points</title>
    <p>
      Any function, linear or not, can be graphed by building a table of <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-values and plotting points.
      Let's look at a few more examples.
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        Imagine a company called Corduroy's-Я-Us that makes pants.
        Their profit from their Royal Blue Corduroys, in thousands of dollars,
        can be modeled by the function <m>P(x)=-0.5x^2+33x-200</m>
        where <m>x</m> is the price of each pair of Royal Blue pants that they sell.
        Let's build a table of values and plot the function's graph.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this context, the value of <m>x</m> must be positive.
        Furthermore, we shouldn't really consider <m>x</m>-values like <m>1</m>, <m>2</m>, etc.,
        because it is not realistic that the price of a pair of new pants would be so low.
        Instead we try multiples of <m>10</m>: <m>10</m>, <m>20</m>, etc.
      </p>

        This doesn't seem to be very effective at generating realistic results.
        The profit values are all negative. This should be expected through,
        if you are selling your pants for $3 or less.
        We should try larger <m>x</m>-values.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Human-initiated global warming has been the subject of some debate.
          However, one aspect of the debate is undeniable fact:
          the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide
          (<m>\mathrm{CO}_2</m>:
          <url href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases" visual="www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases">a greenhouse gas</url>)
          is being
          <url href="https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/graph.html" visual="esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/graph.html">regularly and carefully measured</url>
          and is increasing faster and faster.
          The measured yearly average atmospheric carbon dioxide levels in parts per million (ppm) since 1958
          can be very closely approximated by the function <m>C(x)=244+29\cdot1.0148^x</m>
          where <m>x</m> represents the number of years since the year 1900.
          Before 1958, the greenhouse gases weren't regularly measured.
          Create a table of values rounded to the nearest whole number for the carbon dioxide levels since 1958.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Since 1958 is <m>58</m> years since 1900,
          we will start our table at <m>x=58</m> and go by <m>10</m>s up through <m>x=118</m>,
          which would stand for the year 2018.

          The graph provides a way of seeing patterns and intersections without doing any calculations.
          In this case, we can see that the graph of <m>y=244+29\cdot1.0148^x</m> crosses the graph of <m>y=500</m>
          at about the <m>x</m>-value <m>148</m>. This number, <m>148</m>,
          is our estimate to the solution to the equation <m>244+29\cdot1.0148^x=500</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the <m>x</m>-values indicate the number of years since the year 1900,
          our solution means that in the year 2048,
          the yearly average <m>\mathrm{CO}_2</m> levels will reach <m>500</m> parts per million
          if we continue on our current trajectory.
