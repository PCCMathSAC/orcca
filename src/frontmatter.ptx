        All rights reserved. During the pilot phase, earlier editions of this book were licensed openly. Unfortunately, there were a number of inappropriate uses that surfaced. Of the greatest concern, electronic copies proliferated with broken and inaccessible math content. Also, these copies presented themselves as the original product. In future editions, we hope to use an open license that addresses these concerns, and which we could simply print here in the book. For now, please look for any open licensing information we may post at <url href="https://www.pcc.edu/orcca">pcc.edu/orcca</url>, and please reach out to the project leads if you would like to adapt all or part of this book for your local curricular needs. We'd be happy to consider your request if you are a human being, an educator, and will take care to keep math content accessible in electronic formats.

      This book has been made possible through Portland Community College's Strategic Investment Funding,
      approved by PCC's Budget Planning Advisory Council and the Board of Directors.
      Without significant funding to provide the authors with the adequate time,
      an ambitious project such as this one would not be possible.

      The technology that makes it possible to create synced print,
      eBook, and
      <webwork /> content is <pretext />, created by Rob Beezer.
      David Farmer and the American Institute of Mathematics have worked to make the <pretext /> eBook layout functional,
      yet simple.
      A grant from OpenOregon funded the original bridge between
      <webwork /> and <pretext />.

      This book uses
      <webwork /> to provide most of its exercises,
      which may be used for online homework.
      <webwork /> was created by Mike Gage and Arnie Pizer,
      and has benefited from over <m>25</m> years of contributions from open source developers.
      In 2013, Chris Hughes, Alex Jordan,
      and Carl Yao programmed most of the
      <webwork/> questions in this book with a PCC curriculum development grant.

      The javascript library MathJax,
      created and maintained by David Cervone, Volker Sorge, Christian Lawson-Perfect,
      and Peter Krautzberger allows math content to render nicely on screen in the eBook.
      Additionally, MathJax makes web accessible mathematics possible.

      The print edition (<init>PDF</init>) is built using the typesetting software <latex />,
      created by Donald Knuth and enhanced by Leslie Lamport.

      Each of these open technologies,
      along with many that we use but have not listed here,
      has been enhanced by many additional contributors spanning the past 40 years.

              Static examples may or may not be subdivided into a <q>statement</q>
              followed by a walk-through solution.
              This is basically what traditional examples from math textbooks do.

              not to be confused with the exercises that come at the end of a section that might be assigned for homework, etc.
              In the <init>HTML</init> output, active examples have
              <webwork /> answer blanks where a reader could try submitting an answer.
              In the <init>PDF</init> output,
              active examples are almost indistinguishable from static examples,
              but there is a WeBWorK icon indicating that a reader could interact more actively using the eBook.
              Generally, a walk-through solution is provided immediately following the answer blank.
            </p>

            <p permid="Reg">
              Some <init>HTML</init> readers will skip the opportunity to try an active example and go straight to its solution.
              Some readers will try an active example once and then move on to the solution.
              Some readers will tough it out for a period of time and resist reading the solution.

            <p permid="dsy">
              A reader is <em>not</em> required to try submitting an answer to an active example before moving on.
              A reader <em>is</em> expected to read the solution to an active example,

        Interspersed through a section there are usually several exercises that are intended as active reading exercises.
        A reader can work these examples and submit answers to
        <webwork /> to see if they are correct.
        The important thing is to keep the reader actively engaged instead of providing another static written example.
        In most cases,
        it is expected that a reader will read the solutions to these exercises just as they would be expected to read a more traditional static example.

    <p permid="Neh">
      The authors and the greater PCC faculty have taken various stances on certain pedagogical and notational questions that arise in basic algebra instruction.
      We attempt to catalog these decisions here,

            Interleaving is our preferred approach,
            compared to a proficiency-based approach.
            To us, this means that once the book covers a topic,
            that topic will be appear in subsequent sections and chapters in indirect ways.

                    <p>The <m>y</m>-intercept is a single number, not an ordered pair whose first coordinate is <m>0</m>. The notion of a <m>y</m>-intercept makes sense in higher dimensions than two, so why specify <m>(0,b)</m>? It's also implied in the name, <m>y</m>-intercept, that this place is on the <m>y</m>-axis. So <m>x</m> (and <m>z</m>, <m>w</m>, <etc />) are implied to be <m>0</m>, and there is no need to repeat that in an ordered tuple.</p>

                    <p>We feel similarly for an <m>x</m>-intercept. We acknowledge one downside to this position. And that is the unfortunate situation of a student who calculates an <m>x</m>-intercept of say <m>2</m> and a <m>y</m>-intercept of say <m>3</m> and comes to think that their line passes through <m>(2,3)</m>.</p>

            We round decimal results to four significant digits,

            We do this to maintain consistency with the most common level of precision that
            <webwork /> uses to assess decimal answers.
            We <em>round</em>, not <em>truncate</em>.
            And we use the <m>\approx</m> symbol.

            We believe in always trying to open a topic with some level of application rather than abstract examples.
            From applications and practical questions,
            we move to motivate more abstract definitions and notation.
            This approach is perhaps absent in the first chapter,
            which is intended to be a review only.
            At first this may feel backwards to some instructors,
            with some <q>easier</q> examples
            (with no context)

          <p permid="uqJ">
            Our aim is to not treat inequalities as an add-on optional topic,

            We believe that mathematics is about more than understanding a topic,
            but also about understanding it well enough to communicate results to others.

          <p permid="GFb">
            For example we promote progression of equations like

            When solving equations
            (or systems of linear equations),
            most examples should come with a check,

            In <xref first="chapter-basic-math-review" last="chapter-graphing-lines">Chapters</xref>,
            these checks will be complete simplifications using order of operations one step at a time.
            The later sections will often have more summary checks where either order of operations steps are skipped in groups,
            or we promote entering expressions into a calculator.
            Occasionally in later sections the checks will still have finer details,
            especially when there are issues like with negative numbers squared.

      <title>Basic Arithemtic</title>
      <p permid="FzI">
        The five basic arithmetic operations are:
        addition, subtraction, multiplication, and raising to a power.
        The symbols for addition and subtraction are <m>+</m> and <m>-</m>,
        and both of these are directly avialable on most keyboards as <c>+</c> and <c>-</c>.
      </p>

      <p permid="lGR">
        On paper, multiplication is sometimes written using <m>\times</m> and sometimes written using <m>\cdot</m> (a centered dot).
        Since these symbols are not available on most keyboards, WeBWorK uses <c>*</c> instead,
        which is often <c>shift-8</c> on a full keyboard.
      </p>

      <p permid="ROa">
        On paper, division is sometimes written using <m>\div</m>,
        sometimes written using a fraction layout like <m>\frac{4}{2}</m>,
        and sometimes written just using a slash, <m>/</m>.
        The slash is available on most full keyboards, near the question mark.
        WeBWorK uses <c>/</c> to indicate division.
      </p>

      <p permid="xVj">
        On paper, raising to a power is written using a two-dimensional layout like <m>4^2</m>.
        Since we don't have a way to directly type that with a simple keyboard,
        calculators and computers use the caret character,
        <c>^</c>, as in <c>4^2</c>.
        The character is usually <c>shift-6</c>.

      <title>Roots and Radicals</title>
      <p permid="ecs">
        On paper, a square root is represented with a radical symbol like <m>\sqrt{\phantom{x}}</m>.
        Since a keyboard does not usually have this symbol, WeBWorK and many computer applications use <c>sqrt( )</c> instead.
        For example, to enter <m>\sqrt{17}</m>, type <c>sqrt(17)</c>.
      </p>

      <p permid="KjB">
        Higher-index radicals are written on paper like <m>\sqrt[4]{12}</m>.
        Again we have no direct way to write this using most keyboards.
        In <em>some</em> WeBWorK problems it is possible to type something like <c>root(4, 12)</c> for the fourth root of twelve.
        However this is not enabled for all WeBWorK problems.
      </p>

      <p permid="qqK">
        As an alternative that you may learn about in a later chapter,
        <m>\sqrt[4]{12}</m> is mathematically equal to <m>12^{1/4}</m>,
        so it can be typed as <c>12^(1/4)</c>.
        Take note of the parentheses, which very much matter.

      <title>Common Hiccups with Grouping Symbols</title>
      <p permid="WxT">
        Suppose you wanted to enter <m>\frac{x+1}{2}</m>.
        You might type <c>x+1/2</c>, but this is not right.
        The computer will use the order of operations
        (see <xref ref="section-order-of-operations">Section</xref>)
        and do your division first, dividing <m>1</m> by <m>2</m>.
        So the computer will see <m>x+\frac{1}{2}</m>.
        To address this,
        you would need to use grouping symbols like parentheses,
        and type something like <c>(x+1)/2</c>.
      </p>

      <p permid="CFc">
        Suppose you wanted to enter <m>6^{1/4}</m>,
        and you typed <c>6^1/4</c>.
        This is not right.
        The order of operations places a higher priority on exponentiation than division,
        so it calculates <m>6^1</m> first and then divides the result by <m>4</m>.
        That is simply not the same as raising <m>6</m> to the <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> power.
        Again the way to address this is to use grouping symbols,
        like <c>6^(1/4)</c>.

      <title>Entering Decimal Answers</title>
      <p permid="iMl">
        Often you will find a decimal answer with decimal places that go on and on.
        You are allowed to round, but not by too much.
        WeBWorK generally looks at how many
        <em>significant digits</em> you use,
        and generally expects you to use <alert>four or more</alert> correct significant digits.
      </p>

      <p permid="OTu">
        <q>Significant digits</q> and <q>places past the decimal</q> are not the same thing.
        To count significant digits,
        read the number left to right and look for the first nonzero digit.
        Then count all the digits to the right including that first one.
      </p>

      <p permid="vaD">
        The number <m>102.3</m> has four significant digits,
        but only one place past the decimal.
        This number could be a correct answer to a WeBWorK question.
        The number <m>0.0003</m> has one significant digit and four places past the decimal.
        This number might cause you trouble if you enter it,
        because maybe the <q>real</q> answer was <m>0.0003091</m>,
        and rounding to <m>0.0003</m> was too much rounding.
