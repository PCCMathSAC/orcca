      This book has been made possible through Portland Community College's Strategic Investment Funding,
      approved by PCC's Budget Planning Advisory Council and the Board of Directors.
      Without significant funding to provide the authors with the adequate time,
      an ambitious project such as this one would not be possible.

      The technology that makes it possible to create integrated print,
      <init>HTML</init> eBook, and
      <webwork/> content is <pretext/>, created by Rob Beezer.
      David Farmer and the American Institute of Mathematics deserve credit for
      the <pretext/> <init>HTML</init> eBook layout being feature-rich, yet easy to navigate.
      A grant from OpenOregon funded the original bridge between
      <webwork/> and <pretext/>.

    <p permid="TDn">
      This book uses
      <webwork/> to provide most of its exercises,
      which may be used for online homework.
      <webwork/> was created by Mike Gage and Arnie Pizer,
      and has benefited from over <m>25</m> years of contributions from open source developers.
      In 2013, Chris Hughes, Alex Jordan,
      and Carl Yao programmed most of the
      <webwork/> questions in this book with a PCC curriculum development grant.

      The javascript library MathJax,
      created and maintained by David Cervone, Volker Sorge, Christian Lawson-Perfect,
      and Peter Krautzberger allows math content to render nicely on screen in the <init>HTML</init> eBook.
      Additionally, MathJax makes web accessible mathematics possible.
    </p>

    <p permid="fRF">
      The <init>PDF</init> versions are built using the typesetting software <latex/>,
      created by Donald Knuth and enhanced by Leslie Lamport.
    </p>

    <p permid="LYO">
      Each of these open technologies,
      along with many that we use but have not listed here,
      has been enhanced by many additional contributors over the past 40 years.
      We are indebted to these contributors for their many contributions.
      By releasing this book with an open license,
      we honor their dedication to open software and open education.

        Traditionally,

              These are labeled <q>Example.</q>
              Static examples may or may not be subdivided into a <q>statement</q>
              followed by a walk-through solution.
              This is basically what traditional examples from math textbooks do.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li permid="HKu">
            <title>Active</title>
            <p permid="kWX">
              These are labeled <q>Checkpoint.</q>
              In the <init>HTML</init> version, active examples have
              <webwork/> answer blanks where a reader may try submitting an answer.
              In the <init>PDF</init> output,
              active examples are almost indistinguishable from static examples,
              but there is a <webwork/> icon indicating that a reader could interact more actively using the eBook.
              Generally, a walk-through solution is provided immediately following the answer blank.
            </p>

            <p permid="Reg">
              Some readers using the <init>HTML</init> eBook will skip the opportunity
              to try an active example and go straight to its solution. That is OK.
              Some readers will try an active example once and then move on to just read the solution. That is also OK.
              Some readers will tough it out for a period of time and resist reading the solution
              until they answer the active example themselves.

            <p permid="xlp">
              For readers of the <init>PDF</init>,

            <p permid="dsy">
              A reader is <em>not</em> required to try submitting an answer to an active example before moving on.

              even if they succeed on their own at finding an answer.

      <title>Reading Questions</title>
      <p>
        Each section has a few <q>reading questions</q> immediately before the exercises.
        These may be treated as regular homework questions, but they are intended to be something more.
        The intention is that reading questions could be used in certain classroom models as a tool to
        encourage students to do their assigned reading, and as a tool to measure what basic concepts
        might have been misunderstood by students following the reading.
      </p>
      <p>
        At some point it will be possible for students to log in to the <init>HTML</init> eBook
        and record answers to reading questions for an instructor to review.
        The infrastructure for that feature is not yet in place at the time of printing this edition,

    <title>Pedagogical Decisions</title>
    <p permid="Neh">
      The authors and the greater PCC faculty
      have taken various stances on certain pedagogical and notational questions
      that arise in basic algebra instruction.
      We attempt to catalog these decisions here,
      although this list is certainly incomplete.
      If you find something in the book that runs contrary to these decisions,
      please let us know.

            Basic math is addressed in an appendix. For the course sequence taught at PCC,
            this content is prerequisite and not within the scope of this book.
            However it is quite common for students in the basic algebra sequence to have skills deficiencies
            in these areas, so we include the basic math appendix.
            It should be understood that the content there does not attempt to teach basic math from first principles.
            It is itended to be more of a review.

            Interleaving is our preferred approach,
            compared to a proficiency-based approach.
            To us, this means that once the book covers a topic,
            that topic will be appear in subsequent sections and chapters in indirect ways.

                    <p>The <m>y</m>-intercept is a single number, not an ordered pair whose first coordinate is <m>0</m>. The notion of a <m>y</m>-intercept makes sense in higher dimensions than two, so why specify <m>(0,b)</m>? It's also implied in the name, <m>y</m>-intercept, that this place is on the <m>y</m>-axis. So <m>x</m> (and <m>z</m>, <m>w</m>, <etc />) are implied to be <m>0</m>, and there is no need to repeat that in an ordered tuple.</p>

                    <p>We feel similarly for an <m>x</m>-intercept. We acknowledge one downside to this position. And that is the unfortunate situation of a student who calculates an <m>x</m>-intercept of say <m>2</m> and a <m>y</m>-intercept of say <m>3</m> and comes to think that their line passes through <m>(2,3)</m>.</p>

            We round decimal results to four significant digits,
            or possibly fewer leaving out trailing zeros.
            We do this to maintain consistency with the most common level of precision that
            <webwork/> uses to assess decimal answers.
            We generally <em>round</em>, not <em>truncate</em>,
            and we use the <m>\approx</m> symbol.
            For example, <m>\pi\approx3.142</m> and Portland's population is <m>\approx609500</m>.
            On rare occasions where it is the better option, we truncate and use an ellipsis.

            We believe in opening a topic with some level of application rather than abstract examples,
            whenever that is possible.
            From applications and practical questions,
            we move to motivate more abstract definitions and notation.
            At first this may feel backwards to some instructors,
            with some easier examples
            <em>following</em> more difficult contextual examples.

            We believe that mathematics is about more than understanding a topic,

      <title>Basic Arithmetic</title>
      <p permid="FzI">
        The five basic arithmetic operations are:
        addition, subtraction, multiplication, and raising to a power.
        The symbols for addition and subtraction are <m>+</m> and <m>-</m>,
        and both of these are directly avialable on most keyboards as <c>+</c> and <c>-</c>.
      </p>

      <p permid="lGR">
        On paper, multiplication is sometimes written using <m>\times</m>
        and sometimes written using <m>\cdot</m> (a centered dot).
        Since these symbols are not available on most keyboards, WeBWorK uses <c>*</c> instead,
        which is often <c>shift-8</c> on a full keyboard.
      </p>

      <p permid="ROa">
        On paper, division is sometimes written using <m>\div</m>,
        sometimes written using a fraction layout like <m>\frac{4}{2}</m>,
        and sometimes written just using a slash, <m>/</m>.
        The slash is available on most full keyboards, near the question mark.
        <webwork/> uses <c>/</c> to indicate division.
      </p>

      <p permid="xVj">
        On paper, raising to a power is written using a two-dimensional layout like <m>4^2</m>.
        Since we don't have a way to directly type that with a simple keyboard,
        calculators and computers use the caret character,
        <c>^</c>, as in <c>4^2</c>.
        The character is usually <c>shift-6</c>.

      <title>Roots and Radicals</title>
      <p permid="ecs">
        On paper, a square root is represented with a radical symbol like <m>\sqrt{\phantom{x}}</m>.
        Since a keyboard does not usually have this symbol,
        <webwork/> and many computer applications use <c>sqrt( )</c> instead.
        For example, to enter <m>\sqrt{17}</m>, type <c>sqrt(17)</c>.
      </p>

      <p permid="KjB">
        Higher-index radicals are written on paper like <m>\sqrt[4]{12}</m>.
        Again we have no direct way to write this using most keyboards.
        In <em>some</em> <webwork/> problems it is possible to type something like
        <c>root(4, 12)</c> for the fourth root of twelve.
        However this is not enabled for all <webwork/> problems.
      </p>

      <p permid="qqK">
        As an alternative that you may learn about in a later chapter,
        <m>\sqrt[4]{12}</m> is mathematically equal to <m>12^{1/4}</m>,
        so it can be typed as <c>12^(1/4)</c>.
        Take note of the parentheses, which very much matter.

      <title>Common Hiccups with Grouping Symbols</title>
      <p permid="WxT">
        Suppose you wanted to enter <m>\frac{x+1}{2}</m>.
        You might type <c>x+1/2</c>, but this is not right.
        The computer will use the order of operations
        and do your division first, dividing <m>1</m> by <m>2</m>.
        So the computer will see <m>x+\frac{1}{2}</m>.
        To address this,
        you would need to use grouping symbols like parentheses,
        and type something like <c>(x+1)/2</c>.
      </p>

      <p permid="CFc">
        Suppose you wanted to enter <m>6^{1/4}</m>,
        and you typed <c>6^1/4</c>.
        This is not right.
        The order of operations places a higher priority on exponentiation than division,
        so it calculates <m>6^1</m> first and then divides the result by <m>4</m>.
        That is simply not the same as raising <m>6</m> to the <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> power.
        Again the way to address this is to use grouping symbols,
        like <c>6^(1/4)</c>.
