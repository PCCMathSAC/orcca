  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section, we will learn to differentiate between different types of equations
      and recall the various methods used to solve them.
      Real life doesn't come with instructions, so it is important to develop the skills in this section.
      One day, you might be faced with a geometry problem in your home
      or a rational equation in a lab, and it will be your challenge
      to solve the equation with some strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have solved a variety of equations throughout this book,
      and we covered some general equation-solving strategies in
      <xref ref="section-solving-equations-in-general" text="title"></xref>.
      Since then, we have covered even more topics,
      and it seems time to refresh ourselves on everything that we have done so far.
      Here is a reference guide to all of the sections that cover solving equations.
      We hope that this section will help pinpoint those that you need help with.

  <subsection>
    <title>Types of Equations</title>
    <p>
      The point of this section isn't to compartmentalize your knowledge to help learn small pieces,
      it's to put all the pieces that we've learned previously together
      and how to differentiate those pieces from one another.
      To do that, we need to recall the different types of equations that we have had before.
      <dl>
        <li>
          <title><xref ref="definition-linear-equation-and-inequality" text="title">Linear Equation</xref></title>
          <p>
            This is a type of equation where the variable that we are solving for only appears with
            addition, subtraction, multiplication and division by constant numbers.
            Examples are <m>7(x-2)=\frac{3}{5}x+1</m>
            and <m>rt=4t+3r-1</m> where <m>r</m> is the variable and <m>t</m> is considered a constant.
            Use the <xref ref="algorithm-solve-multistep-linear-equation" text="title"></xref>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title><xref ref="definition-system-of-linear-equations" text="title"></xref></title>
          <p>
            This is a grouping of two linear equations. An example is
            <me>
              \left\{
                \begin{alignedat}{3}
                  y \amp {}={} \amp 3x \amp {}+{} \amp 1 \\
                  y \amp {}={} \amp 2x \amp {}-{} \amp 5
                \end{alignedat}
              \right.
            </me>
            One can use either
            <xref ref="algorithm-solving-systems-of-equations-by-substitution" text="title">substitution</xref> or
            <xref ref="algorithm-solving-systems-of-equations-by-elimination" text="title">elimination</xref>
            to solve these systems.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title><xref ref="definition-quadratic-equation" text="title"></xref></title>
          <p>
            This is a type of equation where at least one side of the equation is a quadratic function,
            and the other side is either constant, linear, or quadratic with a different leading coefficient.
            Examples are <m>3x^2+2x-4=0</m> and <m>6(y-2)^2-1=7</m>.
            There are several methods to solve quadratic equations including using
            <xref ref="fact-square-root-property" text="title">the square root method</xref>,
            <xref ref="fact-the-quadratic-formula" text="title">the quadratic formula</xref>,
            <xref ref="algorithm-solving-quadratic-equations-by-factoring" text="title">factoring</xref>,
            and <xref ref="algorithm-completing-the-square" text="title">completing the square</xref>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title><xref ref="definition-radical-equation" text="title"></xref></title>
          <p>
            This is a type of equation where the variable is inside a root of some kind.
            We usually <xref ref="algorithm-solving-radical-equations" text="title">solve radical equations</xref>
            by isolating the radical and raising both sides to a power to cancel the radical.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title><xref ref="definition-rational-equation" text="title"></xref></title>
          <p>
            This is a type of equation where both sides of the equation are rational functions,
            although it's possible one side is a very simple rational function like a constant function.
            Solving these equations involves
            <xref ref="algorithm-solving-rational-equations" text="title">clearing the denominators</xref>
            and solving the equation that remains.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title><xref ref="section-absolute-value-equations" text="title">Absolute Value Equation</xref></title>
          <p>
            This is a type of equation where the variable is inside absolute value bars.
            Solving these equations involves <xref ref="fact-absolute-value-equation-i" text="title">using a rule</xref>
            to convert an equation from absolute value into two separate equations without absolute values.
          </p>
        </li>
      </dl>
    </p>
    <p>
      For all of these equation types,
      in this section we only concern ourselves with equations in one variable,
      <ie/><nbsp/> the solution will be a number or expression rather than points.
      For example, the equation <m>3=2x+5</m> has a single solution, <m>-1</m>,
      whereas the equation <m>y=2x+5</m> has infinitely many solutions, all points,
      that make up the line with slope <m>2</m> and vertical intercept <m>(0,5)</m>.
      The only exceptions that we will be covering are systems of linear equations,
      which have a point or points as solutions.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Identify the type of equation as linear, a system of linear equations, quadratic, radical, rational, absolute value, or something else.

                Here we will use elimination.
                To use elimination, we need to make one variable have equal but opposite sign in the two equations.
                We will accomplish this by multiplying the second equation by <m>2</m>.

                Now that we have found <m>x</m>, we can substitute that back into one of the equations to find <m>y</m>.
                We will substitute into the first equation.

          Just try to list all the kinds of equations that you know you know.)
