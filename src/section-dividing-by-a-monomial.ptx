    <title>Quotient of Powers Rule</title>
    <p permid="uEA">
      When we <em>multiply</em> the same base raised to powers,
      we <em>add</em> the exponents,
      as in <m>2^{2}\cdot2^{3}=2^{5}</m>.
      What happens when we <em>divide</em> the same base raised to powers?

        <p permid="tUG">
          Without knowing a rule for simplifying this quotient of powers,
          we can write the expressions without exponents and simplify.

          Notice that the difference of the exponents of the numerator and the denominator (<m>5</m> and <m>2</m>,
          respectively) is <m>3</m>,
          which is the exponent of the simplified expression.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p permid="aLJ">
      When we divide as we've just done,
      we end up canceling factors from the numerator and denominator one-for-one.
      These common factors cancel to give us factors of <m>1</m>.
      The general rule for this is:

    <p permid="GSS">
      This rule says that when you're dividing two expressions that have the same base,
      you can simplify the quotient by subtracting the exponents.
      In <xref ref="example-quotient-of-powers-i">Example</xref>,
      this means that we can directly compute <m>\frac{x^5}{x^2}</m>:

      One example of dividing a polynomial is something we already studied in <xref ref="section-standard-form">Section</xref>,
      when we rewrote an equation in standard form in slope-intercept form.
      We'll briefly review this process.
    </p>

    <example permid="nBE">
      <p permid="JTC">
        Rewrite <m>4x-2y=10</m> in slope-intercept form.

      <sidebyside widths="50% 44%" margins="0%" permid="YsG">
        <p permid="qaL">
          In being asked to rewrite this equation in slope-intercept form,
          we're really being asked to solve the equation <m>4x-2y=10</m> for <m>y</m>.
          <md permid="Eeq">
            <mrow>7x-2y \amp= 10</mrow>
            <mrow>7x-2y \highlight{{}-7x} \amp= 10\highlight{{}-7x}</mrow>

            <mrow>y  \amp= -\frac{7}{2}x -5</mrow>
          </md>
          In the final step of work,
          we divided each term on the right side of the equation by <m>-2</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="WhU">
          This is an example of polynomial division that we have already done.
          We'll extend it to more complicated examples,
          many of which involve dividing polynomials by variables
          (instead of just numbers).
        </p>
      </sidebyside>
    </example>

    <p permid="fBG">
      Like polynomial multiplication,
      polynomial division will rely upon distribution.
    </p> -->



    <p permid="LIP">
      Recall that dividing by a number <m>c</m> is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal <m>\frac{1}{c}</m>.
      For example, whether you divide <m>8</m> by <m>2</m> or multiply <m>8</m> by <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>,
      the result is <m>4</m> either way. In symbols,
      <me permid="klz">
        \frac{8}{2}=\frac{1}{2}\cdot8\qquad\text{(both work out to }4\text{)}
      </me>
    </p>

    <p oldpermid="rPY">
      If we apply this idea to a polynomial being divided by a monomial,
      say with <m>\frac{a+b}{c}</m>,
      we can see that the distributive law works for this kind of division as well as with multiplciation:
      <md permid="QsI">
        <mrow>\frac{a+b}{c} \amp= \frac{1}{c}\cdot(a+b)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp= \frac{1}{c}\cdot a + \frac{1}{2}\cdot b</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp= \frac{a}{c} + \frac{b}{c}</mrow>
      </md>
      In the end, the <m>c</m> has been <q>distributed</q> into the <m>a</m> and the <m>b</m>.
      Once we recognize that division by a monomial is distributive,
      we are left with individual monomial pairs that we can divide.

        <p permid="iwm">
          We recognize that the <m>2</m> we're dividing by can be divided into each and every term of the numerator.
          Once we recognize that, we will simply perform those divisions.

        Once you become comfortable with this process,

      We can also look at a variation of division, where we have to fill in the missing gaps from the division process:
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the missing coefficients and exponents that are identified by <q><m>\boxed{ }</m>.</q>
          <me>\frac{\boxed{ }x^6-8x^5+\boxed{ }x^3}{4x^{\boxed{ }}}=5x^{\boxed{ }}+\boxed{ }x^{\boxed{ }}+6x</me>
          Once these values are found, rewrite the entire equation without any <q><m>\boxed{ }</m>.</q>
        </p>

        <p>
          To find these missing values, we need to recognize that the division taking place has two components:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                division of coefficients
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                division of the variable factors
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          We'll want to consider each component separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can start by rewriting the division using distribution and the original equation becomes:
          <me>\frac{\boxed{ }x^6}{4x^{\boxed{ }}}+\frac{-8x^5}{4x^{\boxed{ }}}+\frac{\boxed{ }x^3}{4x^{\boxed{ }}}=5x^{\boxed{ }}+\boxed{ }x^{\boxed{ }}+6x</me>
        </p>

        <p>
          To determine the missing coefficients, we need to look at each division problem individually:
          <dl>
            <li>
              <title> <m>\frac{\boxed{ }x^6}{4x^{\boxed{ }}}=5x^{\boxed{ }}</m></title>
              <p>The only coefficient that would work is if we started with <m>20x^6</m>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <title> <m>\frac{-8x^5}{4x^{\boxed{ }}}=\boxed{ }x^{\boxed{ }}</m></title>
              <p>The only coefficient that would work is if we ended with <m>-2x^{\boxed{ }}</m>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <title> <m>\frac{\boxed{ }x^3}{4x^{\boxed{ }}}=6x</m></title>
              <p>The only coefficient that would work is if we started with <m>24x^4</m>.</p>
            </li>
          </dl>
        </p>

        <p>
          Now that the coefficients are known, we'll turn our attention to the variable factors.
          The complication in trying to figure out the exponents is that we don't know
          what the exponent in the denominator is.
          Figuring this out must be our first step.
        </p>

        <p>
          When we look at the first term, we have <m>\frac{20x^6}{4x^{\boxed{ }}}=5x^{\boxed{ }}</m>.
          We know we had six <m>x</m>'s initially,
          but we don't know how many were canceled by division or how many remained after the canceling.
          We have the same issue with the second term <m>\frac{-8x^5}{4x^{\boxed{ }}}=-2x^{\boxed{ }}</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Only in the third term <m>\frac{24x^3}{4x^{\boxed{ }}}=6x</m> do we know how many <m>x</m>'s
          we started with (three) and how many remained after the division (one).
          The only way this could happen is if we had canceled two <m>x</m>'s,
          so we must have divided by <m>4x^2</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now we know the exponent of the denominator, we can complete the other two terms:
          <me>\frac{20x^6}{4x^2}=5x^4  ~~~\text{and}~~~ \frac{-8x^5}{4x^2}=-2x^3</me>
        </p>

        <p>
          We have now identified every missing coefficient and exponent and can write the complete equation:
          <me>\frac{20x^6-8x^5+24x^3}{4x^2}=5x^4-2x^3+6x</me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the missing coefficients and exponents that are identified by <q><m>\boxed{ }</m>.</q>
          <me>\frac{60x^{\boxed{ }}+48x^{\boxed{ }}+\boxed{ }x^4}{\boxed{ }x^{\boxed{ }}}=\boxed{ }x^6+8x^4-3</me>
          Once these values are found, rewrite the entire equation without any <q><m>\boxed{ }</m>.</q>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We can start by rewriting the division using distribution and the original equation becomes:
          <me>\frac{60x^{\boxed{ }}}{\boxed{ }x^{\boxed{ }}}+\frac{48x^{\boxed{ }}}{\boxed{ }x^{\boxed{ }}}+\frac{\boxed{ }x^4}{\boxed{ }x^{\boxed{ }}}=\boxed{ }x^6+8x^4-3</me>
        </p>

        <p>
          To determine the missing coefficients, we need to first determine the coefficient of the denominator.
          Only the middle term, <m>\frac{48x^{\boxed{ }}}{\boxed{ }x^{\boxed{ }}}=8x^4</m>,
          provides enough information to find that the coefficient of the denominator is <m>6</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now that we know the denominator is <m>6x^{\boxed{ }}</m>, we can fill in the other missing coefficients:
          <me>\frac{60x^{\boxed{ }}}{6x^{\boxed{ }}}+\frac{48x^{\boxed{ }}}{6x^{\boxed{ }}}+\frac{-18x^4}{6x^{\boxed{ }}}=10x^6+8x^4-3</me>
        </p>

        <p>
          Again we'll turn our attention to the variable factors.
          The most useful term to consider at this moment is the third term, <m>\frac{-18x^4}{6x^{\boxed{ }}}=-3</m>.
          We know the original third term contained four <m>x</m>'s.
          We also know there are none left after the division.
          This means all four were canceled, so our denominator must be <m>6x^4</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now that we know the denominator is <m>6x^4</m>, we can fill in the other missing exponents:
          <me>\frac{60x^{10}}{6x^4}+\frac{48x^8}{6x^4}+\frac{-18x^4}{6x^?}=10x^6+8x^4-3</me>
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, we will write the complete equation:
          <me>\frac{60x^{10}+48x^8-18x^4}{6x^4}=10x^6+8x^4-3</me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example> -->

          How is dividing a polynomial by a monomial similar to distributing multiplication over a polynomial?
          For example, how is the process of simplifying <m>\frac{15x^3+5x^2+10x}{5x}</m> similar to simplifying <m>5x\left(15x^3+5x^2+10x\right)</m>?
