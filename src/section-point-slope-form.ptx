    <introduction>
        <p>In <xref ref="section-slope-intercept-form">Section</xref>, we learned that a linear equation can be written in slope-intercept form, <m>y=mx+b\text{.}</m> This section covers an alternative that can often be more useful depending on the application: <term>point-slope form</term>.</p>

    <subsection>
        <title>Point-Slope Definition</title>
        <p>Sometimes, one problem with <xref ref="equation-slope-intercept-form" text="title">slope-intercept form</xref> is that it uses the <m>y</m>-intercept, which might be somewhat meaningless in the context of an application. For example, here is a slope-intercept equation for the population of the United States in year <m>x</m>, where <m>x</m> can be any year from 1990 and beyond, and <m>y</m> is the population measured in millions: <me>y=2.865x-5451\text{.}</me> What can we say about the two numbers <m>2.865</m> and <m>-5451</m>? The slope is <m>2.865</m> with units <m>\frac{y\text{-unit}}{x\text{-unit}}=\frac{\text{million}}{\text{year}}</m>. OK, so there is meaning there: the population has been growing by <m>2.865</m> million people per year.</p>
        <p>But what about <m>-5451</m>? This number tells us that the <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,-5451)</m>, but what practical use is that? It's nonsense to say that in the year 0, the population of the United States was <m>-5451</m> million. It doesn't make sense to have a negative population. It doesn't make sense to talk about the United States population before there even was a United States. And it doesn't make sense to use this model for years earlier than 1990 because it says clearly that the model is for 1990 and beyond.</p>
        <remark>
            <p>If the <m>x</m>-value <m>0</m> is not an appropriate <m>x</m>-value to consider in a linear model, then the <q>initial value</q> <m>b</m> from the slope-intercept form is not meaningful in the context of the model. Its only value is to be part of the formula for calculations. It can still be used to mark a <m>y</m>-intercept on the <m>y</m>-axis, but if you are treating the equation as a mathematical model then you shouldn't be thinking too hard about the portion of the line near the <m>y</m>-axis, since the <m>x</m>-values near <m>0</m> are not relevant.</p>
        </remark>
        <example>
            <p>Since 1990, the population of the United States has been growing by about <m>2.865</m> million per year. Also, back in 1990, the population was <m>253</m> million. Since the rate of growth has been roughly constant, a linear model is appropriate. But let's look for a way to write the equation other than slope-intercept form. Here are some things we know:<ol>
                <li>
                    <p>The slope equation is <m>m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</m>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The slope is <m>m=2.865</m> (million per year).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>One point on the line is <m>(1990,253)</m>, since in 1990, the population was <m>253</m> million.</p>
                </li>
            </ol></p>
            <p>If we use the generic <m>(x,y)</m> to represent a point <em>somewhere</em> on this line, then the rate of change between <m>(1990,253)</m> and <m>(x,y)</m> has to be <m>2.865</m>. So <me>\frac{y-253}{x-1990}=2.865\text{.}</me> There is good reason<fn>It will help us to see that <m>y</m> (population) <em>depends</em> on <m>x</m> (whatever year it is).</fn> to want to isolate <m>y</m> in this equation:<md>
                <mrow>\frac{y-253}{x-1990}\amp=2.865</mrow>
                <mrow>y-253\amp=2.865\multiplyright{(x-1990)}\amp\amp\text{(could distribute, but not going to)}</mrow>
                <mrow>y\amp=2.865(x-1990)\addright{253}</mrow>
            </md></p>
            <p>This is a good place to stop. We have isolated <m>y</m>, and three <em>meaningful</em> numbers appear in the population: the rate of growth, a certain year, and the population in that year. This is a specific example of <term>point-slope form</term>.</p>

            <statement>
                <p>When <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> have a linear relationship where <m>m</m> is the slope and <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> is some specific point that the line passes through, one equation for this relationship is <men xml:id="equation-point-slope-form">y=m\left(x-x_0\right)+y_0</men> and this equation is called the <term>point-slope form</term> of the line. It is called this because the slope and one point on the line are immediately discernible from the numbers in the equation. <idx><h>point-slope form</h></idx><idx><h>form</h><h>point-slope</h></idx></p>

        <p>In the previous exercise, the solution explains that each of the following are acceptable equations for the same line:<md>
            <mrow>y\amp=3(x-3)+2\amp y\amp=3(x-2)-1</mrow>
        </md></p>
        <p>Are those two equations really equivalent? Let's distribute and simplify each of them to get <xref ref="equation-slope-intercept-form" text="title">slope-intercept form</xref>.<md>
            <mrow>y\amp=3(x-3)+2\amp y\amp=3(x-2)-1</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp=3x-9+2\amp y\amp=3x-6-1</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp=3x-7\amp y\amp=3x-7</mrow>
        </md>So, yes. It didn't matter which point we focused on in the line in <xref ref="figure-point-slope-example">Figure</xref>. We get different-looking equations that still represent the same line (which, by the way, has <m>y</m>-intercept at <m>(0,-7)</m>).</p>

        <p>Point-slope form is preferable when we know a line's slope and a point on it, but we don't know the <m>y</m>-intercept.</p>

        <example>
            <p>A spa chain has been losing customers at a roughly constant rate since the year 2010. In 2013, it had <m>2975</m> customers; in 2016, it had <m>2585</m> customers. Management estimated that the company will go out of business once its customer base decreases to <m>1800\text{.}</m> If this trend continues, when will the company close?</p>

            <p>The given information tells us two points on the line: <m>(2013,2975)</m> and <m>(2016,2585)\text{.}</m> The <xref ref="equation-slope-formula" text="title">slope formula</xref> will give us the slope. After labeling those two points as <m>(\overset{x_1}{2013},\overset{y_1}{2975})</m> and <m>(\overset{x_2}{2016},\overset{y_2}{2585})</m>, we have:<md>
                <mrow>\text{slope}\amp=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp=\frac{2585-2975}{2016-2013}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp=\frac{-390}{3}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp=-130</mrow>
            </md>And considering units, this means they are losing <m>130</m> customers per year.</p>

            <p>Let's note that we could try to make an equation for this line in slope-intercept form, but then we would need to calculate the <m>y</m>-intercept, which in context would correspond to the number of customers in year <m>0</m>. We could do it, but we'd be working with numbers that have no real-world meaning in this context.</p>

            <p>For point-slope form, since we calculated the slope, we know at least this much: <me>y=-130(x-x_0)+y_0\text{.}</me> Now we can pick one of those two given points, say <m>(2013,2975)\text{,}</m> and get the equation<me>y=-130(x-2013)+2975\text{.}</me> Note that all three numbers in this equation have meaning in the context of the spa chain.</p>

            <p>We're ready to answer the question about when the chain might go out of business. Substitute <m>y</m> in the equation with <m>1800</m> and solve for <m>x\text{,}</m> and we will get the answer we seek.<md>
                <mrow>y\amp=-130(x-2013)+2975</mrow>
                <mrow>\substitute{1800}\amp=-130(x-2013)+2975</mrow>
                <mrow>1800\subtractright{2975}\amp=-130(x-2013)</mrow>
                <mrow>-1175\amp-130(x-2013)</mrow>
                <mrow>\divideunder{-1175}{-130}\amp=x-2013</mrow>
                <mrow>9.038\amp\approx x-2013</mrow>

                <mrow>2022\amp\approx x</mrow>
            </md>And so we find that at this rate, the company is headed toward a collapse in 2022.</p>

        <title>Using Two Points to Build a Linear Equation</title>

        <p>Since two points can determine a line's location, we can calculate a line's equation using just the coordinates from any two points it passes through.</p>

        <example>
            <statement>

            </statement>

            <solution>
                <p>We will use the <xref ref="equation-slope-formula" text="title">slope formula</xref> to find the slope first. After labeling those two points as <m>(\overset{x_1}{-6},\overset{y_1}{0}) \text{ and } (\overset{x_2}{9},\overset{y_2}{-10})\text{,}</m> we have:<md>

                <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">
                    <p>The point-slope equation is <m>y=-\frac{2}{3}(x-x_0)+y_0\text{.}</m> Next, we will use <m>(9,-10)</m> and substitute <m>x_0</m> with <m>9</m> and <m>y_0</m> with <m>-10\text{,}</m> and we have:<md>

        <title>More on Point-Slope Form</title>
        <p>We can tell a lot about a linear equation now that we have learned both <xref ref="equation-slope-intercept-form" text="title">slope-intercept form</xref> and <xref ref="equation-point-slope-form" text="title">point-slope form</xref>. For example, we can know that <m>y=4x+2</m> is in slope-intercept form because it looks like <m>y=mx+b</m>, it will graph as a line with slope <m>4</m> and vertical intercept <m>(0,2)</m>. Likewise, we know that the equation <m>y=-5(x-3)+2</m> is in point-slope form because it looks like <m>y=m(x-x_0)+y_0</m>, it will graph as a line that has slope <m>-5</m> and will pass through the point <m>(3,2)</m>.</p>

                <p>We could imagine infinitely many equivalent equations for the graph in <xref ref="figure-point-slope-multiple-equations">Figure</xref> if we could find infinitely many points on the graph. In this case, we only need three and there are three integer-coordinate points identified. To write <em>any</em> of these equations, we must first find the slope of the line. Fortunately, we have <xref ref="equation-slope-formula">Equation</xref>. This formula finds the slope between any two points and we will arbitrarily choose <m>(0,30)</m> and <m>(-5,42)</m> to find the slope. Inputting these points into the slope formula yields<ellipsis/>
                    <md>
                        <mrow>m\amp=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp=\frac{\substitute{42}-\substitute{30}}{\substitute{-5}-\substitute{0}}</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp=\frac{12}{-5}</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp=-\frac{12}{5}</mrow>
                    </md>
                Thus the slope of the line is <m>-\frac{12}{5}</m>. This will be the case for any version of the equation of the line that we write.</p>

                <p>Next, we need to write an equation based at each point shown. The first point we will draw attention to is <m>(0,30)</m>. This is the vertical intercept. Thus we should be able to write an equation in slope intercept form, <m>y=mx+b</m>. We know that <m>m=-\frac{12}{5}</m>, and <m>b=30</m>, thus the equation is <m>\highlight{y=-\frac{12}{5}x+30}</m>.</p>
                <p>The next point we will examine is <m>(20,-18)</m>. Since this is not the vertical intercept, the only formula we can use is point-slope form, <m>y=m\left(x-x_0\right)+y_0</m>. We know that <m>m=-\frac{12}{5}</m>, <m>x_0=20</m>, and <m>y_0=-18</m>. Inputting these values into the formula, we achieve <m>\highlight{y=-\frac{12}{5}\left(x-20\right)-18}</m>.</p>
                <p>The last point we have is <m>(-5,42)</m>. Since this is not the vertical intercept, the only formula we can use is point-slope form, <m>y=m\left(x-x_0\right)+y_0</m>. We know that <m>m=-\frac{12}{5}</m>, <m>x_0=-5</m>, and <m>y_0=42</m>. Inputting these values into the formula, we achieve <m>y=-\frac{12}{5}\left(x-(-5)\right)+42</m>. Note that we can simplify this to be <m>\highlight{y=-\frac{12}{5}\left(x+5\right)+42}</m>.</p>
