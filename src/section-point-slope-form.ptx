    <introduction>
        <p>In <xref ref="section-slope-intercept-form">Section</xref>, we learned that a linear equation can be written in slope-intercept form, <m>y=mx+b\text{.}</m> This section covers an alternative that can often be more useful depending on the application: <term>point-slope form</term>.</p>

    <subsection>
        <title>Point-Slope Motivation and Definition</title>
        <p>Starting in 1990, the population of the United States has been growing by about <m>2.865</m> million per year. Also, back in 1990, the population was <m>253</m> million. Since the rate of growth has been roughly constant, a linear model is appropriate. Let's try to write an equation to model this.</p>

        <p>We consider using <xref ref="equation-slope-intercept-form" text="title">slope-intercept form</xref>, but we would need to know the <m>y</m>-intercept, and nothing in the background tells us that. We'd need to know the population of the United States in the year 0, before there even was a United States.</p>

        <p>We could do some side work to calculate the <m>y</m>-intercept, but let's try something else. Here are some things we know:<ol>
            <li>
                <p>The slope equation is <m>m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</m>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The slope is <m>m=2.865</m> (million per year).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>One point on the line is <m>(1990,253)</m>, because in 1990, the population was <m>253</m> million.</p>
            </li>
        </ol></p>
        <p>If we use the generic <m>(x,y)</m> to represent a point <em>somewhere</em> on this line, then the rate of change between <m>(1990,253)</m> and <m>(x,y)</m> has to be <m>2.865</m>. So <me>\frac{y-253}{x-1990}=2.865</me>. There is good reason<fn>It will help us to see that <m>y</m> (population) <em>depends</em> on <m>x</m> (whatever year it is).</fn> to want to isolate <m>y</m> in this equation:<md>
            <mrow>\frac{y-253}{x-1990}\amp=2.865</mrow>
            <mrow>y-253\amp=2.865\multiplyright{(x-1990)}\amp\amp\text{(could distribute, but not going to)}</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp=2.865(x-1990)\addright{253}</mrow>
        </md></p>
        <p>This is a good place to stop. We have isolated <m>y</m>, and three <em>meaningful</em> numbers appear in the population: the rate of growth, a certain year, and the population in that year. This is a specific example of <term>point-slope form</term>. Before we look deeper at point-slope form, let's continue reducing the line equation into slope-intercept form.<md>
            <mrow>y\amp=2.865(x-1990)+253</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp=2.865x - 5701.35 + 253</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp=2.865x - 5448.35</mrow>
        </md></p>

        <p>One concern with <xref ref="equation-slope-intercept-form" text="title">slope-intercept form</xref> is that it uses the <m>y</m>-intercept, which might be somewhat meaningless in the context of an application. For example, here we have found that the <m>y</m>-intercept is at <m>(0,-5448.35)</m>, but what practical use is that? It's nonsense to say that in the year 0, the population of the United States was <m>-5448.35</m> million. It doesn't make sense to have a negative population. It doesn't make sense to talk about the United States population before there even was a United States. And it doesn't make sense to use this model for years earlier than 1990 because the background information says clearly that the rate of change we have applies to years 1990 and later.</p>
        <p>For all these reasons, we prefer the equation when it was in the form <me>y=2.865(x-1990)\addright{253}</me></p>

            <statement>
                <p>When <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> have a linear relationship where <m>m</m> is the slope and <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> is some specific point that the line passes through, one equation for this relationship is <men xml:id="equation-point-slope-form">y=m\left(x-x_0\right)+y_0</men> and this equation is called the <term>point-slope form</term> of the line. It is called this because the slope and one point on the line are immediately discernible from the numbers in the equation.</p>

        <remark>
            <title>Alternative Point-Slope Form</title>
            <p>It is also common to define point-slope form as <men xml:id="equation-point-slope-form-variant">y-y_0=m\left(x-x_0\right)</men> by subtracting <m>y_0</m> from each side. Some exercises may appear using this form.</p>

        </md>The first uses <m>(3,2)</m> as a point on the line, and the second uses <m>(2,-1)</m>. Are those two equations really equivalent? Let's distribute and simplify each of them to get <xref ref="equation-slope-intercept-form" text="title">slope-intercept form</xref>.<md>
            <mrow>y\amp=3(x-3)+2\amp y\amp=3(x-2)-1</mrow>

            <mrow>y\amp=3x-7\amp y\amp=3x-7</mrow>
        </md>So, yes. It didn't matter which point we used to write a point-slope equation. We get different-looking equations that still represent the same line.</p>

        <p>Point-slope form is preferable when we know a line's slope and a point on it, but we don't know the <m>y</m>-intercept.</p>

        <example>
            <p>A spa chain has been losing customers at a roughly constant rate since the year 2010. In 2013, it had <m>2{,}975</m> customers; in 2016, it had <m>2{,}585</m> customers. Management estimated that the company will go out of business once its customer base decreases to <m>1{,}800\text{.}</m> If this trend continues, when will the company close?</p>

            <p>The given information tells us two points on the line: <m>(2013,2975)</m> and <m>(2016,2585)\text{.}</m> The <xref ref="equation-slope-formula" text="title">slope formula</xref> will give us the slope. After labeling those two points as <m>(\overset{x_1}{2013},\overset{y_1}{2975})</m> and <m>(\overset{x_2}{2016},\overset{y_2}{2585})</m>, we have:<md>
                <mrow>\text{slope}\amp=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp=\frac{2585-2975}{2016-2013}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp=\frac{-390}{3}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp=-130</mrow>
            </md>And considering units, this means they are losing <m>130</m> customers per year.</p>

            <p>Let's note that we could try to make an equation for this line in slope-intercept form, but then we would need to calculate the <m>y</m>-intercept, which in context would correspond to the number of customers in year <m>0</m>. We could do it, but we'd be working with numbers that have no real-world meaning in this context.</p>

            <p>For point-slope form, since we calculated the slope, we know at least this much: <me>y=-130(x-x_0)+y_0\text{.}</me> Now we can pick one of those two given points, say <m>(2013,2975)\text{,}</m> and get the equation<me>y=-130(x-2013)+2975\text{.}</me> Note that all three numbers in this equation have meaning in the context of the spa chain.</p>
            <p>We're ready to answer the question about when the chain might go out of business. Substitute <m>y</m> in the equation with <m>1800</m> and solve for <m>x\text{,}</m> and we will get the answer we seek.<md>
                <mrow>y\amp=-130(x-2013)+2975</mrow>
                <mrow>\substitute{1800}\amp=-130(x-2013)+2975</mrow>
                <mrow>1800\subtractright{2975}\amp=-130(x-2013)</mrow>
                <mrow>-1175\amp=-130(x-2013)</mrow>
                <mrow>\divideunder{-1175}{-130}\amp=\divideunder{-130(x-2013)}{-130}</mrow>
                <mrow>9.038\amp\approx x-2013</mrow>
                <mrow>9.038\addright{2013}\amp\approx x</mrow>
                <mrow>2022\amp\approx x</mrow>
            </md>And so we find that at this rate, the company is headed toward a collapse in 2022.</p>

        <title>Using Two Points to Build a Linear Equation</title>

            <p>Note that many other resources use the <xref ref="equation-point-slope-form-variant" text="title">alternate point-slope form</xref> to write their equations. Those equations will always be equivalent to those created using our <xref ref="definition-point-slope-form" text="title">point-slope form</xref>. In <xref ref="example-two-points-to-build-point-slope-form">Example</xref>, we found the point-slope form <m>y=-\frac{2}{3}(x-9)-10</m>.

        <title>More on Point-Slope Form</title>
        <p>We can tell a lot about a linear equation now that we have learned both <xref ref="equation-slope-intercept-form" text="title">slope-intercept form</xref> and <xref ref="equation-point-slope-form" text="title">point-slope form</xref>. For example, we can know that <m>y=4x+2</m> is in slope-intercept form because it looks like <m>y=mx+b</m>. It will graph as a line with slope <m>4</m> and vertical intercept <m>(0,2)</m>. Likewise, we know that the equation <m>y=-5(x-3)+2</m> is in point-slope form because it looks like <m>y=m(x-x_0)+y_0</m>. It will graph as a line that has slope <m>-5</m> and will pass through the point <m>(3,2)</m>.</p>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>For the equations below, state whether they are in slope-intercept form or point-slope form. Then identify the slope of the line and at least one point that the line will pass through.

                <li><p>To write <em>any</em> of the equations representing this line in point-slope form, we must first find the slope of the line and we can use the <xref ref="equation-slope-formula" text="title">slope formula</xref> to do so. We will arbitrarily choose <m>(0,30)</m> and <m>(-5,42)</m> as the two points. Inputting these points into the slope formula yields:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>m\amp=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp=\frac{\substitute{42}-\substitute{30}}{\substitute{-5}-\substitute{0}}</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp=\frac{12}{-5}</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp=-\frac{12}{5}</mrow>
                    </md>
                Thus the slope of the line is <m>-\frac{12}{5}</m>.</p>
                <p>Next, we need to write an equation in point-slope form based on each point shown. Using the point <m>(0,30)</m>, we have:
                <me>y=-\frac{12}{5}(x-0)+30 </me>
                (This simplifies to <m>y=-\frac{12}{5}x+30</m>.)</p>
                <p>The next point is <m>(20,-18)</m>. Using this point, we can write an equation for this line as:
                <me>y=-\frac{12}{5}(x-20)-18</me></p>
                <p>Finally, we can also use the point <m>(-5,42)</m> to write an equation for this line:
                <me>y=-\frac{12}{5}(x-(-5))+42</me>
                which can also be written as:
                <me>y=-\frac{12}{5}(x+5)+42</me>
                </p></li>
                <li><p>As <m>(0,30)</m> is the vertical intercept, we can write the equation of this line in slope-intercept form as <m>y=-\frac{12}{5}x+30</m>. It's important to note that each of the equations that were written in point-slope form simplify to this, making all four equations equivalent.
