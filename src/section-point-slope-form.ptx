      In <xref ref="section-slope-intercept-form">Section</xref>,
      we learned that a linear equation can be written in slope-intercept form,

      point-slope form.

    <title>Point-Slope Motivation and Definition</title>
    <p permid="ihA">
      Starting in 1990, the population of the United States has been growing by about <m>2.865</m> million people per year.
      Also, back in 1990, the population was <m>253</m> million.
      Since the rate of growth has been roughly constant,
      a linear model is appropriate.
      Let's try to write an equation to model this.
    </p>

    <p permid="OoJ">
      We consider using <xref ref="equation-slope-intercept-form" text="custom">slope-intercept form</xref>,
      but we would need to know the <m>y</m>-intercept,
      and nothing in the background tells us that.
      We'd need to know the population of the United States in the year 0, before there even was a United States.
    </p>

    <p permid="uvS">
      We could do some side work to calculate the <m>y</m>-intercept,
      but let's try something else.
      Here are some things we know:

      <ol permid="Fcb">
        <li permid="Chv">
          <p permid="Bcc">
            The slope equation is <m>m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li permid="ioE">
          <p permid="hjl">
            The slope is <m>m=2.865\,\frac{\text{million people}}{\text{year}}</m>, or <m>m=\frac{2.865\,\text{million people}}{1\,\text{year}}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li permid="OvN">
          <p permid="Nqu">
            One point on the line is <m>(1990,253)</m>,
            because in <em>1990</em>, the population was <em>253</em> million.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p permid="aDb">
      If we use the generic <m>(x,y)</m> to represent a point
      <em>somewhere</em> on this line,
      then the rate of change between
      <m>(1990,253)</m> and <m>(x,y)</m> has to be <m>2.865</m>.
      So
      <me permid="XIv">
        \frac{y-253}{x-1990}=2.865
      </me>.
      There is good reason<fn>
      It will help us to see that <m>y</m> (population)
      <em>depends</em> on <m>x</m>
      (whatever year it is).
      </fn> to want to isolate <m>y</m> in this equation:
      <md permid="DPE">
        <mrow>\frac{y-253}{x-1990}\amp=2.865</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{y-253}{x-1990}\multiplyright{(x-1990)}\amp=2.865\multiplyright{(x-1990)}</mrow>
        <mrow>y-253\amp=2.865(x-1990)\amp\amp\text{(could distribute, but not going to)}</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp=2.865(x-1990)\addright{253}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p permid="GKk">
      This is a good place to stop.
      We have isolated <m>y</m>,
      and three <em>meaningful</em> numbers appear in the equation:
      the rate of growth, a certain year,
      and the population in that year.
      This is a specific example of <em>point-slope form</em>.
      Before we look deeper at point-slope form,
      let's continue reducing the line equation into slope-intercept form
      by distributing and combining like terms.
      <md permid="jWN">
        <mrow>y\amp=2.865(x-1990)+253</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp=2.865x - 5701.35 + 253\amp\amp\text{(distributed the }2.865\text{)}</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp=2.865x - 5448.35\amp\amp\text{combined like terms}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p permid="mRt">
      One concern with <xref ref="equation-slope-intercept-form" text="custom">slope-intercept form</xref>
      is that it uses the <m>y</m>-intercept,
      which might be somewhat meaningless in the context of an application.
      For example,
      here we have found that the <m>y</m>-intercept is at <m>(0,-5448.35)</m>,
      but what practical use is that?
      It's nonsense to say that in the year 0, the population of the United States was <m>-5448.35</m> million.
      It doesn't make sense to have a negative population.
      It doesn't make sense to talk about the United States population before there even was a United States.
      And it doesn't make sense to use this model for years earlier than 1990 because the background information says clearly that the rate of change we have applies to years 1990 and later.
    </p>

    <p permid="SYC">
      For all these reasons, we prefer the equation when it was in the form

        y=2.865(x-1990)+253

          When <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> have a linear relationship where <m>m</m> is the slope and

          It is called this because the slope and one point on the line are immediately discernible from the numbers in the equation.

    <p>
      There is a subtraction sign and an addition sign in <xref ref="equation-point-slope-form" text="custom">point-slope form</xref>,
      and you may have trouble remembering which is which.
      But remember that that the line is supposed to pass through <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>.
      So substituting <m>x_0</m> in for <m>x</m> should leave <m>y</m> equal to <m>y_0</m>.
      And it does. For example, consider our example equation <m>y=2.865(x-1990)+253</m>.
      Here, <m>x_0</m> is <m>1990</m> and <m>y_0</m> is <m>253</m>. And:
      <md>
        <mrow>y\amp=2.865(x-1990)+253\amp\amp\text{substitute }1990\text{ for }x\ldots</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp=2.865(\substitute{1990}-1990)+253</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp=2.865(0)+253</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp=253\amp\amp\ldots\text{and }y\text{ works out to be }253</mrow>
      </md>
      The subtraction is exactly where it needs to be to wipe out <m>m(x-x_0)</m>
      and leave you with <m>y_0</m>. More generally:
      <me>
        \underset{\overset{\downarrow}{y_0}}{\strut y \strut}=m(\overset{\overset{x_0}{\downarrow}}{\strut x \strut}-x_0)+y_0
      </me>
    </p>

    <remark permid="xEG">
      <title>Alternative Point-Slope Form</title>
      <p permid="rWL">
        It is also common to define point-slope form as
        <men xml:id="equation-point-slope-form-variant" permid="cso">
          y-y_0=m\left(x-x_0\right)
        </men>
        by subtracting <m>y_0</m> from each side.
        If you learn about point-slope form from some other resource,
        you may come across this.
        We feel that the <m>y=m\left(x-x_0\right)+y_0</m> form will be more helpful
        with college algebra, statistics, and calculus.

      In <xref ref="exercise-point-slope">Checkpoint</xref>,
      the solution explains that each of the following are acceptable equations for the same line:
      <md permid="Izx">
        <mrow>y\amp=3(x-3)+2\amp y\amp=3(x-2)-1</mrow>
      </md>
      The first uses <m>(3,2)</m> as a point on the line,
      and the second uses <m>(2,-1)</m>.
      Are those two equations really equivalent?
      Let's distribute and simplify each of them to get <xref ref="equation-slope-intercept-form" text="custom">slope-intercept form</xref>.
      <md permid="oGG">
        <mrow>y\amp=3(x-3)+2\amp y\amp=3(x-2)-1</mrow>

        <mrow>y\amp=3x-7\amp y\amp=3x-7</mrow>

      So, yes.
      It didn't matter which point we used to write a point-slope equation.
      We get different-looking equations that still represent the same line.
    </p>

    <p permid="fmU">
      Point-slope form is preferable when we know a line's slope and a point on it,
      but we don't know the <m>y</m>-intercept. We recognie that distributing the slope
      and combining like terms can always be used to find the line's slope-intercept form.

    <example permid="Rxx">
      <p permid="CvQ">
        A spa chain has been losing customers at a roughly constant rate since the year 2010.
        In 2013, it had <m>2975</m> customers;
        in 2016, it had <m>2585</m> customers.
        Management estimated that the company will go out of business once its customer base decreases to
        <m>1800</m>. If this trend continues,
        when will the company close?
      </p>

      <p permid="iCZ">
        The given information tells us two points on the line:
        <m>(2013,2975)</m> and <m>(2016,2585)</m>. The <xref ref="equation-slope-formula" text="custom">slope formula</xref> will give us the slope.
        After labeling those two points as
        <m>(\overset{x_1}{2013},\overset{y_1}{2975})</m> and <m>(\overset{x_2}{2016},\overset{y_2}{2585})</m>, we have:
        <md permid="UNP">
          <mrow>\text{slope}\amp=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp=\frac{2585-2975}{2016-2013}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp=\frac{-390}{3}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp=-130</mrow>
        </md>
        And considering units,
        this means they are losing <m>130</m> customers per year.
      </p>

      <p permid="OKi">
        Let's note that we could try to make an equation for this line in slope-intercept form,
        but then we would need to calculate the <m>y</m>-intercept,
        which in context would correspond to the number of customers in year <m>0</m>.
        We could do it,
        but we'd be working with numbers that have no real-world meaning in this context.
      </p>

      <p permid="uRr">
        For point-slope form, since we calculated the slope,
        we know at least this much:
        <me permid="AUY">
          y=-130(x-x_0)+y_0
        </me>.
        Now we can pick one of those two given points,
        say <m>(2013,2975)</m>, and get the equation
        <me permid="hch">
          y=-130(x-2013)+2975
        </me>.
        Note that all three numbers in this equation have meaning in the context of the spa chain.
        The <m>-130</m> tells us how many customers are leaving per year,
        the <m>2013</m> represents a year, and the <m>2975</m> tells us the number of customers in that year.
      </p>

      <p oldpermid="aYA">
        We're ready to answer the question about when the chain might go out of business.
        We need to substitute the given value of <m>1800</m> into the appropriate place in our equation.
        In order to substitute correctly, we must clearly understand what the variable <m>y</m> represents
        including its units, and what the variable <m>x</m> represents including its units.
        Write down those definitions first in any question you attempt to answer.
        It will save you time in the long run, and avoid frustration.
        Knowing the variable <m>y</m> represents the number of customers in a given year
        allows one to understand that <m>y</m> must be replaced with <m>1800</m> customers.
        Knowing the variable <m>x</m> represents a year
        allows one to understand that <m>x</m> will <em>not</em> be substituted,
        because we are trying to <em>solve</em> for what year something happens.

                To write <em>any</em> of the equations representing this line in point-slope form,
                we must first find the slope of the line and we can use the <xref ref="equation-slope-formula" text="custom">slope formula</xref> to do so.
                We will arbitrarily choose <m>(0,30)</m> and <m>(-5,42)</m> as the two points.
                Inputting these points into the slope formula yields:

                Next, we need to write an equation in point-slope form based on each point shown.
