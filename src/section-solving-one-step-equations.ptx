    <title>Imagine Filling in the Blanks</title>
    <p permid="qrC">
      Let's start with a very simple situation <mdash /> so simple,
      that you might have success entirely in your head without writing much down.
      It's not exactly the algebra we want you to learn,
      but the example may serve as a good warm-up.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-first-solution" permid="PSo">
      <p permid="EQG">
        A number plus <m>2</m> is <m>6</m>.
        What is that number?
      </p>

      <p permid="kXP">
        You may be so familiar with basic arithmetic that you know the answer already.
        The <em>algebra</em> approach would be to start by translating
        <q>A number plus <m>2</m> is <m>6</m></q>
        into a math statement <mdash /> in this case, an equation:
        <me permid="pmj">
          x+2=6
        </me>
        where <m>x</m> is the number we are trying to find.
        In other words,
        what should be substituted in for <m>x</m><ellipsis />
        <me permid="Vts">
          x+2=6
        </me>
        <ellipsis /> to make the equation true?
      </p>

      <p permid="ReY">
        Now, how do you determine what <m>x</m> is?
        One valid option is to just <em>imagine</em>
        what number you could put in place of <m>x</m> that would result in a true equation.
        Would <m>0</m> work?
        No, that would mean <m>0+2\stackrel{\text{no}}{=}6</m>.
        Would <m>17</m> work?
        No, that would mean <m>17+2\stackrel{\text{no}}{=}6</m>.
        Would <m>4</m> work?
        Yes, because <m>4+2=6</m> is a true equation.
      </p>

      <p permid="xmh">
        So one solution to <m>x+2=6</m> is <m>4</m>.
        No other numbers are going to be solutions,
        because when you add <m>2</m> to something smaller or larger than <m>4</m>,
        the result is going to be smaller or larger than <m>6</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p permid="WyL">
      This approach might work for you to solve
      <em>very basic equations</em>,
      but in general equations are going to be too complicated to solve in your head this way.
      So we move on to more systematic approaches.

      <p permid="CFU">
        Let's revisit <xref ref="example-first-solution">Example</xref>,
        thinking it through differently.

      <example permid="vZx">
        <p permid="dtq">
          If a number plus <m>2</m> is <m>6</m>, what is the number?
        </p>

        <p permid="JAz">
          One way to solve this riddle is to use the opposite operation.
          If a number <em>plus</em> <m>2</m> is <m>6</m>,
          we should be able to <em>subtract</em>
          <m>2</m> from <m>6</m> and get that unknown number.
          So the unknown number is <m>6-2=4</m>.
        </p>
      </example>

      <p permid="iNd">
        Let's try this strategy with another riddle.
      </p>

      <example permid="cgG">
        <p permid="pHI">
          If a number minus <m>2</m> is <m>6</m>, what is the number?

          <m>2</m> to <m>6</m> to get the unknown number.
          So the unknown number is <m>6+2=8</m>.
        </p>
      </example>

      <p permid="OUm">
        Does this strategy work with multiplication and division?
      </p>

      <example xml:id="example-two-x-equals-six" permid="InP">
        <p permid="VOR">
          If a number times <m>2</m> is <m>6</m>, what is the number?
          This time, we should be able to <em>divide</em>
          <m>6</m> by <m>2</m> to get the unknown number.
          So the unknown number is <m>6\div2=3</m>.

          If a number divided by <m>2</m> equals <m>6</m>, what is the number?

        As is common in algebra,

        To find the weight of the unknown block,
        we can take away <m>2</m> one-pound blocks from

      <p permid="nwW">
        An equation is like a balanced scale,
        as the two sides of the equation are equal.
        In the same way that we can take away <m>2</m> lb from <em>both</em>
        sides of a balanced scale,
        we can subtract <m>2</m> on <em>both</em>
        sides of the equals sign.
        So instead of two pictures of balance scales,
        we can use algebra symbols and solve the equation <m>x+2=6</m> in the following manner:

            <idx><h>equivalent equation</h></idx>
        In other words,
        each equation shown is algebraically equivalent to the one above it and the one below it and will have exactly the same solution(s).
        The final equivalent equation <m>x=4</m> tells us that the <term>solution</term>
        to the equation is <m>4</m>.
        The <term>solution set</term> to this equation is the set that lists every solution to the equation.
        For this example, the solution set is <m>\{4\}</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="zLo">
        We have learned we can add or subtract the same number on both sides of the equals sign,

      <p permid="sgP">
        We can see from the scale that <m>x=3</m> is correct.
        Removing half of the weight on both sides of the scale is like dividing both sides of an equation by <m>2</m>:

        </md>
        The equivalent equation in this example is <m>x=3</m>,
        which tells us that the solution to the equation is <m>3</m> and the solution set is <m>\{3\}</m>.

      <remark permid="AJq">
        <p permid="fiD">
          Note that when we divide each side of an equation by a number,
          we use the fraction line in place of the division symbol.
          The fact that <m>\frac{6}{2}=6\div2</m> is a reminder that the fraction line and division symbol have the same purpose.
          The division symbol is rarely used in later math courses.

          Another way to be rid of the

          <m>d</m> is being <em>divided</em> by <m>-3</m>.

                      Consider which is greater:
                      <m><var name="$big"/> - <var name="$little"/></m> or <m><var name="$little"/> - <var name="$big"/></m>?
                      To make the largest value for <m>x</m>,
                      you must put <var name="$little"/> in the left blank and <var name="$big"/> in the right blank because you solve this equation by subtracting <var name="$little"/> from both sides.
                      This makes <m>x = <var name="$big"/> - <var name="$little"/></m>,
                      which is the largest possible value for <m>x</m>.
