    <title>Imagine Filling in the Blanks</title>
    <p permid="qrC">
      Let's start with a very simple situation<mdash/>so simple,
      that you might have success entirely in your head without writing much down.
      It's not exactly the algebra we hope you will learn,
      but the example may serve as a good warm up.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-first-solution" permid="PSo">
      <p permid="EQG">
        A number plus <m>2</m> is <m>6</m>.
        What is that number?
      </p>

      <p permid="kXP">
        You may be so familiar with basic arithmetic that you know the answer already.
        The <em>algebra</em> approach is to translate
        <q>A number plus <m>2</m> is <m>6</m></q>
        into a math statement<mdash/>in this case, an equation:
        <me permid="pmj">
          x+2=6
        </me>
        where <m>x</m> is the number we are trying to find.
        And then ask what should be substituted in for <m>x</m> to make the equation true.
      </p>

      <p permid="ReY">
        Now, how do you determine what <m>x</m> is?
        One valid option is to just <em>imagine</em>
        what number you could put in place of <m>x</m> that would result in a true equation.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Would <m>0</m> work? No, that would mean <m>0+2=6</m>, which is false.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Would <m>17</m> work? No, that would mean <m>17+2=6</m>, which is false.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Would <m>4</m> work? Yes, because <m>4+2=6</m> is a true equation.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p permid="xmh">
        So one solution to <m>x+2=6</m> is <m>4</m>.
        No other numbers are going to be solutions,
        because when you add <m>2</m> to something smaller than <m>4</m>,
        the result is going to be smaller than <m>6</m>,
        and when you add <m>2</m> to something larger than <m>4</m>,
        the result is going to be larger than <m>6</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p permid="WyL">
      This approach might work for you to solve
      <em>very basic</em> equations,
      but in general equations are going to be too complicated to solve in your head this way.
      So we move on to more systematic approaches.

    <title>The Basic Principle of Algebra</title>
    <p permid="CFU">
      Let's revisit <xref ref="example-first-solution">Example</xref>,
      thinking it through differently.
    </p>

    <example permid="vZx">
      <p permid="dtq">
        If a number plus <m>2</m> is <m>6</m>, what is the number?
      </p>

      <p permid="JAz">
        If a number <em>plus</em> <m>2</m> is <m>6</m>,
        the number is a little smaller than <m>6</m>,
        and we should be able to <em>subtract</em>
        <m>2</m> from <m>6</m> and get that unknown number.
        Doing that: <m>6-2=4</m>. Thinking things through this way,
        we are using the <em>opposite</em> operation from addition: subtraction.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p permid="iNd">
      Let's try this strategy with another riddle.
    </p>

    <example permid="cgG">
      <p permid="pHI">
        If a number minus <m>2</m> is <m>6</m>, what is the number?
        Now we have a number a little larger than <m>6</m> in mind.
        This time, if we <em>add</em>
        <m>2</m> to <m>6</m> we will find the unknown number.
        So the unknown number is <m>6+2=8</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p permid="OUm">
      Does this strategy work with multiplication and division?
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-two-x-equals-six" permid="InP">
      <p permid="VOR">
        If a number times <m>2</m> is <m>6</m>, what is the number?
        The mystery number is small, since it gets multipled by <m>2</m>
        to make <m>6</m>. If we <em>divide</em>
        <m>6</m> by <m>2</m>, we will find the unknown number.
        So the unknown number is <m>\frac{6}{2}=3</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example permid="ouY">
      <p permid="BWa">
        If a number divided by <m>2</m> equals <m>6</m>, what is the number?
        Now we must have had a larger number to start with,
        since cutting it in half made <m>6</m>.
        If we <em>multiply</em> <m>6</m> by <m>2</m>,
        we find the unknown number is <m>6\cdot2=12</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

      <title>Abbreviation for <q>pound</q></title>

        Why is <q>lb</q> the abbreviation for <q>pound</q>?

      These examples explore an important principle for solving an equation<mdash/>applying an opposite arithmetic operation.
      We can revisit <xref ref="example-first-solution">Example</xref> and more intentionally
      apply this strategy.
      If a number plus <m>2</m> is <m>6</m>, what is the number?
      As is common in algebra,
      we use <m>x</m> to represent the unknown number.
      The question translates into the math equation
      <me permid="BAB">
        x+2=6

      Try to envision the equals sign as the middle of a balanced scale.

      To find the weight of the unknown block,
      we can take away <m>2</m> one-pound blocks from
      <em>each</em> side of the scale

      An equation is like a balanced scale,
      as the two sides of the equation are equal.
      In the same way that we can take away <m>2</m> lb from <em>each</em>
      side of a balanced scale,
      we can subtract <m>2</m> from <em>each</em>
      side of the equation.
      So instead of two pictures of balance scales,
      we can use algebra symbols and solve the equation <m>x+2=6</m> in the following manner:

      In other words,
      each equation shown is algebraically equivalent to the one above it and will have exactly the same solution(s).
      The final equivalent equation <m>x=4</m> tells us that the <term>solution</term>
      to the equation is <m>4</m>.
      The <term>solution set</term> to this equation is the set that lists every solution to the equation.

      Currently, the scale is balanced.
      If we cut the weight in half on both sides,
      the scale should still be balanced.
    </p>

    <p permid="sgP">
      We can see from the scale that <m>x=3</m> is correct.
      Removing half of the weight from each side of the scale is like dividing both sides of an equation by <m>2</m>:

        <mrow>\divideunder{2x}{2}\amp=\divideunder{6}{2}</mrow>

      </md>
      The equivalent equation in this example is <m>x=3</m>,
      which tells us that the solution to the equation is <m>3</m> and the solution set is <m>\{3\}</m>.

    <remark permid="AJq">
      <p permid="fiD">
        Note that when we divide each side of an equation by a number,
        we use the fraction line in place of the division symbol.
        The fact that <m>\frac{6}{2}=6\div2</m> is a reminder that the fraction line and division symbol have the same purpose.
        The division symbol is rarely used in later math courses.

    <p permid="YnY">
      Similarly, we could multiply each side of an equation by <m>2</m>,
      just like we can keep a scale balanced if we double the weight on each side.

      When equations have fractions,
      solving them will make use of the same principles.
      You may need to use fraction arithmetic,
