    <introduction>
        <p>We have learned how to check whether a specific number is a solution to an equation or inequality. In this section, we will begin learning how to <em>find</em> the solution(s) to basic equations ourselves.</p>

        <title>Imagine Filling in the Blanks</title>

        <p>Let's start with a very simple situation <mdash /> so simple, that you might have success entirely in your head without writing much down. It's not exactly the algebra we want you to learn, but the example may serve as a good warm-up.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-first-solution">
            <p>A number plus <m>2</m> is <m>6</m>. What is that number?</p>

            <p>You may be so familiar with basic arithmetic that you know the answer already. The <em>algebra</em> approach would be to start by translating <q>A number plus <m>2</m> is <m>6</m></q> into a math statement <mdash /> in this case, an equation: <me>x+2=6</me> where <m>x</m> is the number we are trying to find. In other words, what should be substituted in for <m>x</m><ellipsis /><me>x+2=6</me><ellipsis /> to make the equation true?</p>

            <p>Now, how do you determine what <m>x</m> is? One valid option is to just <em>imagine</em> what number you could put in place of <m>x</m> that would result in a true equation. Would <m>0</m> work? No, that would mean <m>0+2\stackrel{\text{no}}{=}6</m>. Would <m>17</m> work? No, that would mean <m>17+2\stackrel{\text{no}}{=}6</m>. Would <m>4</m> work? Yes, because <m>4+2=6</m> is a true equation.</p>

            <p>So one solution to <m>x+2=6</m> is <m>4</m>. No other numbers are going to be solutions, because when you add <m>2</m> to something smaller or larger than <m>4</m>, the result is going to be smaller or larger than <m>6</m>.</p>
        </example>

        <p>This approach might work for you to solve <em>very basic equations</em>, but in general equations are going to be too complicated to solve in your head this way. So we move on to more systematic approaches.</p>

        <title>The Basic Principle of Algebra</title>

        <subsubsection>
            <title>Opposite Operations</title>

            <p>Let's revisit <xref ref="example-first-solution">Example</xref>, thinking it through differently.</p>

            <example>
                <p>If a number plus <m>2</m> is <m>6</m>, what is the number?</p>

                <p>One way to solve this riddle is to use the opposite operation. If a number <em>plus</em> <m>2</m> is <m>6</m>, we should be able to <em>subtract</em> <m>2</m> from <m>6</m> and get that unknown number. So the unknown number is <m>6-2=4</m>.</p>
            </example>

            <p>Let's try this strategy with another riddle.</p>

            <example>
                <p>If a number minus <m>2</m> is <m>6</m>, what is the number? This time, we should be able to <em>add</em> <m>2</m> to <m>6</m> to get the unknown number. So the unknown number is <m>6+2=8</m>.</p>
            </example>

            <p>Does this strategy work with multiplication and division?</p>

            <example xml:id="example-two-x-equals-six">
                <p>If a number times <m>2</m> is <m>6</m>, what is the number? This time, we should be able to <em>divide</em> <m>6</m> by <m>2</m> to get the unknown number. So the unknown number is <m>6\div2=3</m>.</p>
            </example>

            <example>
                <p>If a number divided by <m>2</m> equals <m>6</m>, what is the number? This time, we can <em>multiply</em> <m>6</m> by <m>2</m>, and the unknown number is <m>6\cdot2=12</m>.</p>
            </example>

            <p>These examples explore an important principle for solving an equation <mdash/> applying an opposite arithmetic operation.</p>

        <subsubsection xml:id="subsection-balancing">
            <title>Balancing Equations Like a Scale</title>

            <p>We can revisit <xref ref="example-first-solution">Example</xref> with yet another strategy. If a number plus <m>2</m> is <m>6</m>, what is the number? As is common in algebra, we can use <m>x</m> to represent the unknown number. The question translates into the math equation <me>x+2=6</me>. Try to envision the equals sign as the middle of a balanced scale. The left side has <m>2</m> one-pound objects and a block with unknown weight <m>x</m> lb. Together, the weight on the left is <m>x+2</m>. The right side has <m>6</m> one-pound objects. <xref ref="figure-balance-scale">Figure</xref> shows the scale.</p>

            <p>To find the weight of the unknown block, we can take away <m>2</m> one-pound blocks from <em>both</em> sides of the scale (to keep the scale balanced). <xref ref="figure-balance-scale-solution">Figure</xref> shows the solution.</p>


            <p>An equation is like a balanced scale, as the two sides of the equation are equal. In the same way that we can take away <m>2</m> lb from <em>both</em> sides of a balanced scale, we can subtract <m>2</m> on <em>both</em> sides of the equals sign. So instead of two pictures of balance scales, we can use algebra symbols and solve the equation <m>x+2=6</m> in the following manner:<md>
                <mrow>x+2\amp=6\amp\amp\text{a balanced scale}</mrow>
                <mrow>x+2\subtractright{2}\amp=6\subtractright{2}\amp\amp\text{remove the same quantity from each side}</mrow>
                <mrow>x\amp=4\amp\amp\text{still balanced; now it tells you the solution}</mrow>
            </md></p>

            <p>It's important to note that each line shows what is called an <term>equivalent equation</term><idx><h>equivalent equation</h></idx>. In other words, each equation shown is algebraically equivalent to the one above it and the one below it and will have exactly the same solution(s). The final equivalent equation <m>x=4</m> tells us that the <term>solution</term> to the equation is <m>4</m>. The <term>solution set</term> to this equation is the set that lists every solution to the equation. For this example, the solution set is <m>\{4\}</m>.</p>

            <p>We have learned we can add or subtract the same number on both sides of the equals sign, just like we can add or remove the same amount of weight on a balanced scale. Can we multiply and divide the same number on both sides of the equals sign?</p>

            <p>Let's look at <xref ref="example-two-x-equals-six">Example</xref> again: If a number times <m>2</m> is <m>6</m>, what is the number? Another balance scale can help visualize this.</p>

            <p>Currently, the scale is balanced. If we cut the weight in half on both sides, the scale should still be balanced.</p>

            <p>We can see from the scale that <m>x=3</m> is correct. Removing half of the weight on both sides of the scale is like dividing both sides of an equation by <m>2</m>:<md>
                <mrow>2x\amp=6</mrow>
                <mrow>\divideunder{2x}{2}\amp=\divideunder{6}{2}</mrow>
                <mrow>x\amp=3</mrow>
            </md>The equivalent equation in this example is <m>x=3</m>, which tells us that the solution to the equation is <m>3</m> and the solution set is <m>\{3\}</m>.</p>

            <remark>
                <p>Note that when we divide each side of an equation by a number, we use the fraction line in place of the division symbol. The fact that <m>\frac{6}{2}=6\div2</m> is a reminder that the fraction line and division symbol have the same purpose. The division symbol is rarely used in later math courses.</p>
            </remark>

            <p>Similarly, we could multiply both sides of an equation by <m>2</m>, just like we can keep a scale balanced if we double the weight on each side. We will summarize these properties.</p>

        <p>Notice that when we solved equations in <xref ref="subsection-balancing">Subsection</xref>, the final equation looked like <m>x=\text{number}</m>, where the variable <m>x</m> is separated from other numbers and stands alone on one side of the equals sign. The goal of solving any equation is to <em>isolate the variable</em> in this same manner.</p>

        <p>Putting together both strategies (applying the opposite operation and balancing equations like a scale) that we just explored, we will summarize how to solve a one-step linear equation.</p>

        <example>
            <statement>
                  <p>The formula for a circle's circumference is <m>C=\pi d</m>, where <m>C</m> stands for circumference, <m>d</m> stands for diameter, and <m>\pi</m> is a constant with the value of <m>3.1415926\ldots</m>. If a circle's circumference is <quantity><mag>12\pi</mag><unit base="foot"/></quantity>, find this circle's diameter and radius.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>The circumference is given as <m>12\pi</m> feet. Approximating <m>\pi</m> with <m>3.14</m>, this means the circumference is approximately <quantity><mag>37.68</mag><unit base="foot"/></quantity>. It is nice to have a rough understanding of how long the circumference is, but if we use <m>3.14</m> instead of <m>\pi</m>, we are using a slightly smaller number than <m>\pi</m>, and the result of any calculations we do would not be as accurate. This is why we will use the symbol <m>\pi</m> throughout solving this equation and round only at the end in the conclusion summary (if necessary).</p>

                <p>We will substitute <m>C</m> in the formula with <m>12\pi</m> and solve for <m>d</m>:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>C\amp=\pi d</mrow>
                        <mrow>\substitute{12\pi}\amp=\pi d</mrow>

                    </md>
                </p>

                <p>So the circle's diameter is <quantity><mag>12</mag><unit base="foot"/></quantity>. And since radius is half of diameter, the radius is <quantity><mag>6</mag><unit base="foot"/></quantity>.</p>

            <statement>
                <p>Solve for <m>b</m> in <m>-b=2</m>.</p>

            <solution>
                <p>Note that <m>b</m> is not yet isolated as there is a negative sign in front of it. One way to solve for <m>b</m> is to recognize that multiplying on both sides by <m>-1</m> would clear away that negative sign:<md>

                    <mrow>b\amp=-2</mrow>
                </md></p>

                <p>We removed the negative sign from <m>-b</m> using the fact that <m>-1\cdot(-b)=b</m>. A second way to remove the negative sign <m>-1</m> from <m>-b</m> is to divide both sides by <m>-1</m>. If you view the original <m>-b</m> as <m>-1\cdot b</m>, then this approach resembles the solution from <xref ref="exercise-solve-equation-solution-on-left">Checkpoint</xref>.<md>
                    <mrow>-b\amp=2</mrow>
                    <mrow>-1\cdot b\amp=2</mrow>

                    <mrow>b\amp=-2</mrow>
                </md></p>

                <p>A third way to remove the original negative sign, is to recognize that the opposite operation of negation is negation. So negating both sides will work out too:<md>

            <statement>

            <solution>
                <p>It's true that in this example, the variable <m>d</m> is <em>multiplied</em> by <m>-\frac{1}{3}</m>. This means that <em>dividing</em> each side by <m>-\frac{1}{3}</m> would be a valid strategy for solving this equation. However, dividing by a fraction could lead to human error, so consider this alternative strategy.</p>

                <p>Another way to be rid of the <m>-\frac{1}{3}</m> is to multiply by <m>-3</m>. Indeed, <m>-\frac{1}{3}d</m> is the same as <m>\frac{d}{-3}</m>, and when we view the expression this way, <m>d</m> is being <em>divided</em> by <m>-3</m>. So multiplying by <m>-3</m> would be the opposite operation.<md>

                </md></p>

                <p>If you choose to divide each side by <m>-\frac{1}{3}</m>, that will work out as well:<md>
