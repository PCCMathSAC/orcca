        <p>We have learned how to check whether a specific number is a solution to an equation or inequality. In this section, we will begin learning how to <em>find</em> the solution(s) to basic inequalities ourselves.</p>

        <p>With one small complication, we can use very similar properties to <xref ref="fact-properties-of-equivalent-equations">Fact</xref> when we solve inequalities (as opposed to equations).</p>

                    <title>Divide on both sides by a <em>positive</em> number</title>
                    <p>If <m>2\lt4</m>, then <m>\divideunder{2}{2}\stackrel{\checkmark}{\lt}\divideunder{4}{2}</m>.</p>
                </li>
            </dl></p>

        <p>However, something interesting happens when we multiply or divide by the same <em>negative</em> number on both sides of an inequality: the direction reverses!  To understand why, consider <xref ref="figure-multiply-by-negative">Figure</xref>, where the numbers <m>2</m> and <m>4</m> are multiplied by the negative number <m>-1</m>. </p>

        <p>So even though <m>2\lt4</m>, if we multiply both sides by <m>-1</m>, we have <m>-2\stackrel{\text{no}}{\lt}-4</m>. (The true inequality is <m>-2\gt-4</m>.)</p>

        <p>In general, we must apply the following property when solving an inequality.</p>

        <fact xml:id="fact-changing-direction-of-inequality-sign">
            <title>Changing the Direction of the Inequality Sign</title>
            <statement>
                <p>When we multiply or divide each side of an inequality by the same <em>negative</em> number, the inequality sign must change direction. <em>Do not</em> change the inequality sign when multiplying/dividing by a positive number, or when adding/subtracting by any number.</p>
            </statement>
        </fact>

        <example xml:id="example-inequality-one-step-negative-coefficient">
            <statement>
                <p>Solve the inequality <m>-2x\geq12</m>. State the solution set graphically, using interval notation, and using set-builder notation. (Interval notation and set-builder notation are discussed in <xref ref="section-notation-for-intervals">Section</xref>.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>To solve this inequality, we will divide each side by <m>-2</m>:

                        <mrow>x\amp\leq-6</mrow>
                    </md>
                </p>

                <p>Note that the inequality sign changed direction at the step where we divided each side of the inequality by a <em>negative</em> number.</p>

                <p>When we solve a linear <em>equation</em>, there is usually exactly one solution. When we solve a linear <em>inequality</em>, there are usually infinitely many solutions. For this example, any number smaller than <m>-6</m> or equal to <m>-6</m> is a solution.</p>

                <p>There are at least three ways to represent the solution set for the solution to an inequality: graphically, with set-builder notation, and with interval notation. Graphically, we represent the solution set as:</p>

                        <![CDATA[\begin{tikzpicture}
                            \begin{axis}[numberline,
                                        xmin=-10,xmax=10,
                                        xtick={-10,-8,...,10},
                                        minor xtick={-9,-7,...,9}
                                        ]
                                \addplot[infiniteclosedinterval] coordinates {(-10,0) (-6,0)};
                            \end{axis}
                        \end{tikzpicture}]]>

                    </image>
                </sidebyside>

                <p>Using interval notation, we write the solution set as <m>(-\infty,-6]</m>. Using set-builder notation, we write the solution set as <m>\{x\mid x\leq-6\}</m>.</p>

                <p>As with equations, we should check solutions to catch both human mistakes as well as for possible extraneous solutions (numbers which were <em>possible</em> solutions according to algebra, but which actually do not solve the inequality).</p>

                <p>Since there are infinitely many solutions, it's impossible to literally check them all. We found that all values of <m>x</m> for which <m>x\leq-6</m> are solutions. One approach is to check that <m>-6</m> satisfies the inequality, and also that one number less than <m>-6</m> (any number, your choice) is a solution.<md>

                </md></p>

                <p>Thus both <m>-6</m> and <m>-7</m> are solutions. It's important to note this doesn't directly verify that <em>all</em> solutions to this inequality check. But it is evidence that our solution is correct, and it's valuable in that making these two checks would likely help us catch an error if we had made one. Consult your instructor to see if you're expected to check your answer in this manner.</p>

            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>To solve this inequality, we will subtract <m>7</m> from each side. There is not much difference between this process and solving the <em>equation</em> <m>t+7=5</m>, because we are not going to multiply or divide by negative numbers.<md>
