    <introduction>
        <p>When we talk about <em>how many</em> or <em>how much</em> of something we have, it often makes sense to use different types of numbers. For example, if we are counting dogs in a shelter, the possibilities are only <m>0,1,2,\ldots</m>. (It would be difficult to have <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> of a dog.) On the other hand if you were weighing a dog in pounds, it doesn't make sense to only allow yourself to work with whole numbers. The dog might weigh something like <m>28.35</m> pounds. These examples highlight how certain kinds of numbers are appropriate for certain situations. We'll classify various types of numbers in this section.</p>

        <title>Set Notation</title>
        <p>What is the mathematical difference between these three <q>lists?</q> <me>28, 31, 30\qquad\{28, 31, 30\}\qquad(28, 31, 30)</me> To a mathematician, the last one, <m>(28, 31, 30)</m> is an <em>ordered</em> triple. What matters is not merely the three numbers, but <em>also</em> the order in which they come. The ordered triple <m>(28, 31, 30)</m> is not the same as <m>(30, 31, 28)</m>; they have the same numbers in them, but the order has changed. For some context, February has <m>28</m> days; <em>then</em> March has <m>31</m> days; <em>then</em> April has <m>30</m> days. The order of the three numbers is meaningful in that context.</p>

        <p>With curly braces and <m>\{28, 31, 30\}</m>, a mathematician sees a collection of numbers and does not particularly care in which order they are written. Such a collection is called a <term>set</term><idx><h>set</h></idx>. All that matters is that these numbers are part of a collection. They've been <em>written</em> in some particular order because that's necessary to write them down. But you might as well have put the three numbers in a bag and shaken up the bag. For some context, maybe your favorite three NBA players have jersey numbers <m>30</m>, <m>31</m>, and <m>28</m>, and you like them all equally well. It doesn't really matter what order you use to list them.</p>

        <p>So we can say: <md>
            <mrow>\{28, 31, 30\}\amp=\{30, 31, 28\}\amp(28, 31, 30)\amp\neq(30, 31, 28)</mrow>
        </md></p>

        <p>What about just writing <m>28, 31, 30</m>? This list of three numbers is ambiguous. Without the curly braces or parentheses, it's unclear to a reader if the order is important. <term>Set notation</term><idx><h>set notation</h></idx> is the use of curly braces to surround a list/collection of numbers, and we will use set notation frequently in this section.</p>

        <title>Different Number Sets</title><idx><h>types of numbers</h></idx>
        <p>In the introduction, we mentioned how different sets of numbers are appropriate for different situations. Here are the basic sets of numbers that are used in basic algebra.</p>

                <title>Natural Numbers</title><idx><h>natural numbers</h></idx>
                <p>When we count, we begin: <m>1, 2, 3, \dots</m> and continue on in that pattern. These numbers are known as <term>natural numbers</term>.</p>
                <p><m>\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,\dots \}</m></p>
            </li>

                <title>Whole Numbers</title><idx><h>whole numbers</h></idx>
                <p>If we include zero, then we have the set of <term>whole numbers</term>.</p>
                <p><m>\{0,1,2,3,\dots \}</m> has no standard symbol, but some options are <m>\mathbb{N}_0</m>, <m>\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}</m>, and <m>\mathbb{Z}_{\geq0}</m>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <title>Integers</title><idx><h>integers</h></idx>
                <p>If we include the negatives of whole numbers, then we have the set of <term>integers</term>.</p>
                <p><m>\mathbb{Z}=\{\dots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\dots \}</m>.</p>
                <p>A <m>\mathbb{Z}</m> is used because one word in German for <q>numbers</q> is <q>Zahlen.</q></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <title>Rational Numbers</title><idx><h>rational numbers</h></idx>
                <p>A <term>rational number</term> is any number that <em>can</em> be written as a fraction of integers, where the denominator is nonzero. Alternatively, a <term>rational number</term> is any number that <em>can</em> be written with a decimal that terminates or that repeats.</p>
                <p><m>\mathbb{Q}=\left\{0,1,-1,2,\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2},-2,3,\frac{1}{3},-\frac{1}{3},-3,\frac{3}{2},\frac{2}{3}\ldots\right\}</m></p>
                <p><m>\mathbb{Q}=\left\{0,1,-1,2,0.5,-0.5,-2,3,0.\overline{3},-0.\overline{3},-3,1.5,0.\overline{6}\ldots\right\}</m></p>
                <p>A <m>\mathbb{Q}</m> is used because fractions are <em>q</em>uotients of integers.</p>

            <li>
                <title>Irrational Numbers</title><idx><h>irrational numbers</h></idx>
                <p>Any number that <em>cannot</em> be written as a fraction of integers belongs to the set of <term>irrational numbers</term>. Another way to say this is that any number whose decimal places goes on forever without repeating is an <term>irrational number</term>. Some examples include <m>\pi\approx3.1415926\ldots</m>, <m>\sqrt{15}\approx3.87298\ldots</m>, <m>e\approx2.71828\ldots</m></p>
                <p>There is no standard symbol for the set of irrational numbers.</p>

            <li>
                <title>Real Numbers</title><idx><h>real numbers</h></idx>
                <p>Any number that can be marked somewhere on a number line is a <term>real number</term>. Real numbers might be the only numbers you are familiar with. For a number to <em>not</em> be real, you have to start considering things called <em>complex numbers</em>, which are not our concern right now.</p>
                <p>The set of real numbers can be denoted with <m>\mathbb{R}</m> for short.</p>

            <title>Rational Numbers in Other Forms</title>
            <p>Any number that <em>can</em> be written as a ratio of integers is rational, even if it's not written that way at first. For example, these numbers might not look rational to you at first glance: <m>-4</m>, <m>\sqrt{9}</m>, <m>0\pi</m>, and <m>\sqrt[3]{\sqrt{5}+2}-\sqrt[3]{\sqrt{5}-2}</m>. But they are all rational, because they can respectively be written as <m>\frac{-4}{1}</m>, <m>\frac{3}{1}</m>, <m>\frac{0}{1}</m>, and <m>\frac{1}{1}</m>.</p>
        </warning>

        <example>
            <title>Determine If Numbers Are This Type or That Type</title>
            <statement>
                <p>Determine which numbers from the set <m>\left\{-102, -7.25, 0, \frac{\pi}{4}, 2, \frac{10}{3},  \sqrt{19}, \sqrt{25}, 10.\overline{7} \right\}</m> are natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, irrational numbers, and real numbers.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>All of these numbers are real numbers, because all of these numbers can be positioned on the real number line.</p>
                <p>Each real number is either rational or irrational, and not both. <m>-102</m>, <m>-7.25</m>, <m>0</m>, and <m>2</m> are rational because we can see directly that their decimal expressions terminate. <m>10.\overline{7}</m> is also rational, because its decimal expression repeats. <m>\frac{10}{3}</m> is rational because it is a ratio of integers. And last but not least, <m>\sqrt{25}</m> is rational, because that's the same thing as <m>5</m>.</p>
                <p>This leaves only <m>\frac{\pi}{4}</m> and <m>\sqrt{19}</m> as irrational numbers. Their decimal expressions go on forever without entering a repetitive cycle.</p>
                <p>Only <m>-102</m>, <m>0</m>, <m>2</m>, and <m>\sqrt{25}</m> (which is really <m>5</m>) are integers.</p>
                <p>Of these, only <m>0</m>, <m>2</m>, and <m>\sqrt{25}</m> are whole numbers, because whole numbers excludes the negative integers.</p>
                <p>Of these, only <m>2</m> and <m>\sqrt{25}</m> are natural numbers, because the natural numbers exclude <m>0</m>.</p>

    <subsection>
        <title>Converting Repeating Decimals to Fractions</title>

        <p>We have learned that a terminating decimal number is a rational number. It's easy to convert a terminating decimal number into a fraction of integers: you just need to multiply and divide by one of the numbers in the set <m>\{10,100,1000,\ldots\}</m>. For example, when we say the number <m>0.123</m> out loud, we say <q>one hundred and twenty-three thousandths.</q> While that's a lot to say, it makes it obvious that this number can be written as a ratio: <me>0.123=\frac{123}{1000}</me>. Similarly, <me>21.28=\frac{2128}{100}=\frac{532\cdot4}{25\cdot4}=\frac{532}{25}</me>, demonstrating how <em>any</em> terminating decimal can be written as a fraction.</p>

        <p>Repeating decimals can also be written as a fraction. To understand how, use a calculator to find the decimal for, say, <m>\frac{73}{99}</m> and <m>\frac{189}{999}</m> You will find that<me>\frac{73}{99}=0.73737373\ldots=0.\overline{73}\qquad\frac{189}{999}=0.189189189\ldots=0.\overline{189}</me>. The pattern is that diving a number by a number from <m>\{9,99,999,\ldots\}</m> with the same number of digits will create a repeating decimal that starts as <q><m>0.</m></q> and then repeats the numerator. We can use this observation to reverse engineer some fractions from repeating decimals.</p>

        <p>Converting a repeating decimal to a fraction is not always quite this straightforward. There are complications if the number takes a few digits before it begins repeating. For your interest, here is one example on how to do that.</p>

        <example>
            <p>Can we convert the repeating decimal <m>9.134343434\ldots=9.1\overline{34}</m> to a fraction? The trick is to separate its terminating part from its repeating part, like this:<me>9.1+0.034343434\ldots</me>. Now note that the terminating part is <m>\frac{91}{10}</m>, and the repeating part is almost like our earlier examples, except it has an extra <m>0</m> right after the decimal. So we have:<me>\frac{91}{10}+\frac{1}{10}\cdot0.34343434\ldots</me>. With what we learned in the earlier examples and basic fraction arithmetic, we can continue:<md>
                <mrow>9.134343434\ldots\amp=\frac{91}{10}+\frac{1}{10}\cdot0.34343434\ldots</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp=\frac{91}{10}+\frac{1}{10}\cdot\frac{34}{99}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp=\frac{91}{10}+\frac{34}{990}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp=\frac{91\multiplyright{99}}{10\multiplyright{99}}+\frac{34}{990}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp=\frac{9009}{990}+\frac{34}{990}=\frac{9043}{990}</mrow>
            </md></p>
            <p>Check that this is right by entering <m>\frac{9043}{990}</m> into a calculator and seeing if it returns the decimal we started with, <m>9.134343434\ldots</m>.</p>
        </example>
