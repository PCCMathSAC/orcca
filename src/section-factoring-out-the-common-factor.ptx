      In <xref ref="chapter-exponents-and-polynomials">Chapter</xref>,
      we learned how to multiply polynomials,
      such as when you start with
      <m>(x+2)(x+3)</m> and obtain <m>x^2+5x+6</m>.
      This chapter, starting with this section,
      is about the <em>opposite</em> process<mdash/>factoring.
      For example, starting with
      <m>x^2+5x+6</m> and obtaining <m>(x+2)(x+3)</m>.
      We will start with the simplest kind of factoring:
      for example starting with <m>x^2+2x</m> and obtaining <m>x(x+2)</m>.

    <title>Motivation for Factoring</title>
    <p permid="bhv">
      When you write <m>x^2+2x</m>,
      you have an algebraic expression built with two terms<mdash/>two parts that are
      <em>added</em> together.
      When you write <m>x(x+2)</m>,
      you have an algebraic expression built with two factors<mdash/>two parts that are
      <em>multiplied</em> together.
      Factoring is useful, because sometimes
      (but not always)
      having your expression written as parts that are <em>multiplied</em>
      together makes it easy to simplify the expression.
    </p>

    <p permid="HoE">
      You've seen this with fractions.
      To simplify <m>\frac{15}{35}</m>,
      breaking down the numerator and denominator into factors is useful:
      <m>\frac{3\cdot5}{7\cdot5}</m>.
      Now you can see that the factors of <m>5</m> cancel. <!-- But if you had started with the numerator and denominator broken into additive parts like <m>\frac{7+8}{22+13}</m>, that's just not helpful to simplify the fraction. -->
    </p>

    <p permid="nvN">
      There are a few other reasons to appreciate the value of factoring that will float to the surface in this chapter and beyond.

  <subsection permid="LvH">
    <title>Identifying the Greatest Common Factor</title>
    <p permid="TCW">
      The most basic technique for factoring involves recognizing the
      <term>greatest common factor</term>
          <idx><h>G.C.F.</h></idx>
          <idx><h>greatest common factor</h></idx>
      between two expressions,
      which is the largest factor that goes in evenly to both expressions.
      For example,
      the greatest common factor between <m>6</m> and <m>8</m> is <m>2</m> since <m>2</m> goes in nicely into both <m>6</m> and <m>8</m> and no larger number would divide both <m>6</m> and <m>8</m> nicely.
    </p>

    <p permid="zKf">
      Similarly, the greatest common factor between <m>4x</m> and <m>3x^2</m> is <m>x</m>.
      If you write <m>4x</m> as a product of its factors,
      you have <m>2\cdot 2 \cdot x</m>.
      And if you fully factor <m>3x^2</m>,
      you have <m>3\cdot x\cdot x</m>.
      The only factor they have in common is <m>x</m>,
      so that is the greatest common factor.
      No larger expression goes in nicely to both expressions.
    </p>

    <example permid="UPt">
      <title>Finding the Greatest Common Factor</title>
      <p permid="jRn">
        What is the common factor between <m>6x^2</m> and <m>70x</m>?
        Break down each of these into its factors:
        <md permid="QIq">
          <mrow>6x^2 \amp =2\cdot3\cdot x\cdot x \amp 70x \amp =2\cdot5\cdot7\cdot x</mrow>
          <intertext>And identify the common factors:</intertext>
          <mrow>6x^2 \amp =\attention{2}\cdot3\cdot \attention{x}\cdot x \amp 70x \amp =\attention{2}\cdot5\cdot7\cdot \attention{x}</mrow>
        </md>
        With <m>2</m> and <m>x</m> in common,
        the greatest common factor is <m>2x</m>.
      </p>

    <title>Factoring Out the Greatest Common Factor</title>
    <p permid="LYx">
      We have learned the distributive property: <m>a(b+c)=ab+ac</m>.
      Perhaps you have thought of this as a way to <q>distribute</q>
      the number <m>a</m> to each of <m>b</m> and <m>c</m>.
      In this section,
      we will use the distributive property in the opposite way.
      If you have an expression <m>ab+ac</m>,
      it is equal to <m>a(b+c)</m>.
      In that example, we factored out <m>a</m>,
      which is the common factor between <m>ab</m> and <m>ac</m>.

    <title>More Examples of Factoring out the Common Factor</title>
    <p permid="kBh">
      Previous examples did not cover every nuance with factoring out the greatest common factor.
      Here are a few more factoring examples that attempt to do so.
    </p>

    <example permid="ybW">
      <p permid="APy">
        Factor <m>-35m^5+5m^4-10m^3</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="gWH">
        First, we identify the common factor.
        The number <m>5</m> is the greatest common factor of the three coefficients
        (which were <m>-35</m>, <m>5</m>, and <m>-10</m>)
        and also <m>m^3</m> is the largest expression that divides <m>m^5</m>,
        <m>m^4</m>, and <m>m^3</m>.
        Therefore the greatest common factor is <m>5m^3</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="NdQ">
        In this example, the leading term is a negative number.
        When this happens,
        we will make it common practice to take that negative as part of the greatest common factor.
        So we will proceed by factoring out <m>-5m^3</m>.
        Note the sign changes.

      <p permid="Zsi">
        Notice that the terms are not in a standard order,

        It is usually a best practice to rearrange the terms into the standard order first.

      <p permid="Fzr">
        The number <m>7</m> divides all of the numerical coefficients.
        Separately, no power of <m>n</m> is part of the greatest common factor because the <m>14</m> term has no <m>n</m> factors.
        So the greatest common factor is just <m>7</m>.
        We proceed by factoring that out:

        There are no common factors in those three terms,
