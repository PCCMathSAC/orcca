        <title>Introduction to Functions</title>

        <p>When working with two variables, we are interested in the relationship between those two variables. For example, consider the two variables of hare population and lynx population in a Canadian forest. If we know the value of one variable, are we able to determine the value of the second variable? If we know that one variable is increasing over time, do we know if the other is increasing or decreasing?</p>

            <title>Relation</title>
            <statement>
                <p>A <term>relation</term><idx><h>relation</h></idx> is a very general situation between two variables, where having a little bit of information about one variable could tell you something about the other variable. For example, if you know the hare population is high this year, you can say the lynx population is probably increasing. So <q>hare population</q> and <q>lynx population</q> make a relation. If one of the variables is identified as the <q>first</q> variable, the relation's <term>domain</term><idx><h>relation</h><h>domain</h></idx> is the set of all values that variable can take. Likewise, the relation's <term>range</term><idx><h>relation</h><h>range</h></idx> is the set of all values that the second variable can take.</p>
            </statement>
        </definition>

        <p>We are not so much concerned with relations in this book. But we are interested in a special type of relation called a function. Informally, a <term>function</term><idx><h>function</h><h>informal definition</h></idx> is a device that takes input values for one variable one by one, thinks about them, and gives respective output values one by one for the other variable.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-function-chicken-to-egg-color">
            <p>Mariana has <m>5</m> chickens: Hazel, Yvonne, Georgia, Isabella, and Emma. For the relation <q>Chicken to Egg Color,</q> the first variable (the input) is a chicken's name and the second variable (the output) is the color of that chicken's eggs. The relation's domain is the set of all of Mariana's chicken's names, and its range is the set of colors of her chicken's eggs. <xref ref="figure-two-pairs-inputs-outputs-relation-chicken-to-egg-color">Figure</xref> shows two inputs and their corresponding outputs.</p>

                <p>It would not be convenient to make diagrams like the ones in <xref ref="figure-two-pairs-inputs-outputs-relation-chicken-to-egg-color">Figure</xref> for all five chickens. There are too many inputs. Instead, <xref ref="figure-chicken-to-egg-color">Figure</xref> represents the function graphically in a more concise way.

            <p>We can also use a set of ordered pairs to represent this function:<me>\{(\text{Hazel}, \text{Tan}), (\text{Yvonne}, \text{Brown}), (\text{Georgia}, \text{Brown}), (\text{Isabella}, \text{White}), (\text{Emma}, \text{Green})\}</me> where you read the ordered pair left to right, with the first value as an input and the second value as its output.</p>

                <p>In mathematics, a function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of outputs with the property that each input is related to exactly one output.</p>

        </definition>

        <p>In <xref ref="figure-chicken-to-egg-color">Figure</xref>, we can see each chicken's name (input) is related to exactly one output, so the relation <q>Chicken to Egg Color</q> qualifies as a function. Note that it is irrelevant that multiple inputs might related to the same output, like in <m>(\text{Yvonne}, \text{brown})</m> and <m>(\text{Georgia}, \text{brown})</m>. The point is that whichever chicken you are thinking about, you know exactly which color egg it lays.</p>


        <example>
            <p>Next, we will look at the <q>inverse</q> relation named <q>Egg Color to Chicken.</q> Here we consider the color of an egg to be the input, and want the output to be the name of a chicken. If the egg is green, we know it is Emma's. But what if the egg is brown?</p>

                <p>In <xref ref="figure-egg-color-to-chicken">Figure</xref>, we can see the color brown (an input) is related to <em>two</em> outputs, Yvonne and Georgia. This disqualifies the relation <q>Egg Color to Chicken</q> from being a function. (It is still a <em>relation</em>, because in general knowing the egg color does give you <em>some</em> information about which chicken it may have come from.)</p>

    <subsection>
        <title>Functions as Predictors</title>

        <p>Functions are useful because they describe our ability to accurately predict a result. If we can predict something precisely every time, then there is a function involved.</p>

        <example>
            <p>If you go to the store and buy <m>5</m> two-dollar cans of soup, then you should predict that your total will be <m>\$10</m>. No matter if you buy the soup in the morning, afternoon, or evening. If it doesn't total <m>\$10</m>, then the cash register isn't <em>functioning</em>.</p>
        </example>

        <example>
            <p>A vending machine is like a function. You push a button and the item you desired pops out. In this case, the inputs are all of the buttons that you can press, and the outputs are the kinds of candy bars, chip bags, etc.<nbsp/>that can come out. The mechanics and electronics that connect the buttons with the items represent the function.</p>

            <p>Going in a little further, if the button <c>A1</c> delivers a bag of <pubtitle>M<ampersand />M's</pubtitle>, then you would be surprised if you pressed <c>A1</c> and got anything other than <pubtitle>M<ampersand />M's</pubtitle>. In this case, the machine wouldn't be functioning and you would get upset at your prediction ability being taken away.</p>

            <p>What if buttons <c>A1</c> and <c>B3</c> both delivered <pubtitle>M<ampersand />M's</pubtitle>?  Would that violate the definition a function?</p>

            <p>No, the vending machine is still a function even if two buttons generate the same output. Remember that to be a function, each <em>input</em> must generate a single output; that output doesn't have to be unique for each input. So as long as each button generates the same item each time you press it, there can be two buttons that deliver the same item.</p>
        </example>

        <example>
            <p>Some relations are not functions, because they can't be used to make <m>100\%</m> accurate predictions. For example, if you have a student's first name and want to determine their student ID number, you probably won't be able to look it up. For a common first name like <q>Michael,</q> there will be many student ID number possibilities. Multiple outputs for a single input make <q>student ID number</q> not be a function of <q>first name.</q></p>

            <p>On the other hand, if we exchange the variables and think of the ID number as the first variable, then there is only one student that ID number applies to, and there is only one official first name for that person. So <q>first name</q> <em>is</em> a function of <q>student ID number.</q></p>
        </example>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
        <title>Algebraic Functions</title>

        <p>Many functions have specific algebraic formulas to turn an input number into an output number. We explore some examples here.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-electrician-real-life-function">
            <p>Aylen is an electrician who is hired to install a new circuit. She charges <m>\$111</m> to come to your house and then, in addition, <m>\$89</m> per hour to do the work. If <m>x</m> represents the total number of hours that the job takes and <m>y</m> represents the total cost of her work, in dollars, then the equation <m>y=89x+111</m> relates the variables.</p>

            <p>We know that at the end of the job, if Aylen worked <m>x</m> hours, you are going to have <em>one</em> bill that totals <m>89x+111</m>. This must mean that the bill is a function of the number of hours of labor. For every possible number of hours that she could work, you would only get one bill for that cost.</p>

            <p>Context aside, the expression <m>89x+111</m> represents a function of <m>x</m>, because it can be used to turn an input number <m>x</m> into a specific output. In fact, every algebraic expression in one variable represents a function for similar reasons.</p>
        </example>

        <example>
            <p>The equation <m>x^2+y^2=25</m> represents a relation that is not a function, where we view <m>x</m> as the <q>first variable</q> as usual. Remember that to <em>not</em> be a function, all we have to do is find one input that has two outputs. Let's pick a nice easy input number to test: <m>x=4</m>. Substituting this value gives us
            <md>
                <mrow>x^2+y^2\amp=25</mrow>
                <mrow>(\substitute{4})^2+y^2\amp=25</mrow>
                <mrow>16+y^2\amp=25</mrow>
                <mrow>y^2\amp=9</mrow>
            </md>
            At this point, we see that <m>y</m> could be <m>3</m> <em>or</em> <m>y</m> could be <m>-3</m>. There are two <m>y</m>-values for the single <m>x</m>-value, so that must mean that <m>x^2+y^2=25</m> cannot represent a function.</p>

        <title>Function Notation</title>

        <p>We know that the equation <m>y=5x+3</m> represents <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>, because for each <m>x</m>-value (input), there is only one <m>y</m>-value (output). If we want to determine the value of the output when the input is <m>2</m>, we'd replace <m>x</m> with <m>2</m> and find the value of <m>y</m>:<md>
            <mrow>y\amp= 5(\substitute{2})+3</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp= 10+3</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=13</mrow>
        </md>Our end result is that <m>y=13</m>. Well, <m>y</m> <em>is</em> <m>13</m>, but only in the situation when <m>x</m> is <m>2</m>. In general, for other inputs, <m>y</m> is not going to be <m>13</m>.  So the equation <m>y=13</m> is lacking in the sense that it is not communicating everything we might want to say. It does not communicate the value of <m>x</m> that we used. <term>Function notation</term><idx><h>function</h><h>notation</h></idx> will allow us to communicate <em>both</em> the input <em>and</em> the output at the same time. It will also allow us to give each function a name, which is helpful when we have multiple functions.</p>

        <p>Functions can have names just like variables. The most common function name is <m>f</m>, since <q>f</q> stands for <q>function.</q> A letter like <m>f</m> doesn't stand for a single number though. Instead, it represents an input-output relation like we've been discussing in this section.</p>

        <p>We will write equations like <m>y=f(x)</m>, and what we mean is:<ul>
            <li>
                <p><q>y equals f <em>of</em> x</q></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>the function's name is <m>f</m></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>the input variable is <m>x</m></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>the parentheses following the <m>f</m> surround the input; they do <em>not</em> indicate multiplication</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>the output variable is <m>y</m></p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>

        <remark>
            <p>Parentheses have a lot of uses in mathematics. Their use with functions is very specific, and it's important to note that <m>f</m> is <em>not</em> being multiplied by anything when we write <m>f(x)</m>. With function notation, the parentheses specifically are just meant to indicate the input by surrounding the input.</p>
        </remark>

        <example>
            <p>The expression <m>f(x)</m> is read as <q><m>f</m> of <m>x</m>,</q> and the expression <m>f(2)</m> is read as <q><m>f</m> of <m>2</m>.</q> Be sure to practice saying this correctly while reading.</p>

            <p>The expression <m>f(2)</m> means that <m>2</m> is being treated as an input, and the function <m>f</m> is turning it into an output. And then <m>f(2)</m> represents that actual output number.</p>
        </example>

        <remark>
            <p>The most common letters used to represent functions are <m>f,g,</m> and <m>h</m>. The most common variables we use are <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m>. But we can use any function name and any input and output variable. When dealing with functions in context, it often makes sense to use meaningful function names and variables. For example, if we are modeling temperature of a cup of coffee as a function of time with a function <m>C</m>, we could use <m>T=C(t)</m>, where <m>T</m> is the temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) after <m>t</m> minutes.</p>

        <title>Evaluating Functions</title>

        <p>When we determine a function's value for a specific input, this is known as <em>evaluating a function</em>. To do so, we replace the input with the numerical value given and determine the associated output.</p>

        <p>When using function notation, instead of writing <m>5x+3</m> or <m>y=5x+3</m>, we often write something like <m>f(x)=5x+3</m>. We are saying that the rule for function <m>f</m> is to use the expression <m>5x+3</m>. To find <m>f(2)</m>, wherever you see <m>x</m> in the formula <m>f(x)=5x+3</m>, substitute in <m>2</m>:<md>
            <mrow>f(\highlight{x})\amp=5\highlight{x}+3</mrow>
            <mrow>f(\substitute{2})\amp=5(\substitute{2})+3</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=10+3</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=13</mrow>
        </md>Our end result is that <m>f(2)=13</m>, which tells us that <m>f</m> turns <m>2</m> into <m>13</m>. In other words, when the input is <m>2</m>, the output will be <m>13</m>.</p>

        <title>Solving Equations That Have Function Notation</title>

        <p><em>Evaluating</em> a function and <em>solving</em> an equation that has function notation in it are two separate things. Students understandably mix up these two tasks, because they are two sides of the same coin. Evaluating a function means that you know an input (typically, an <m>x</m>-value) and then you calculate an output (typically, a <m>y</m>-value). Solving an equation that has function notation in it is the opposite process. You know an output (typically, a <m>y</m>-value) and then you determine all the inputs that could have led to that output (typically, <m>x</m>-values).</p>

        <title>Domain and Range</title>

        <p>Earlier we defined the domain and range of a relation. We repeat those definitions more formally here, specifically for functions.</p>

        <definition xml:id="definition-domain-and-range">
            <title>Domain and Range</title>
            <statement>
                <p>Given a function <m>f</m>, the <term>domain</term> of <m>f</m> is the collection of all valid input values for <m>f</m>. The <term>range</term> of <m>f</m> is the collection of all possible output values of <m>f</m>.<idx><h>function</h><h>domain</h></idx><idx><h>function</h><h>range</h></idx></p>
            </statement>
        </definition>

        <p>When working with functions, a common necessary task is to determine the function's domain and range. Also, the ability to identify domain and range is strong evidence that a person really understands the <em>concepts</em> of domain and range.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-function-yes-no-ordered-pairs">
            <title>Functions Defined by Ordered Pairs</title>
            <statement>
                <p>The function <m>f</m> is defined by the ordered pairs <me>\{(1,2), (3,-2), (5,2), (7,-4), (9,6)\}</me>. Determine the domain and range of <m>f</m>.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>The ordered pairs tell us that <m>f(1)=2</m>, <m>f(3)=-2</m>, etc. So the valid input values are <m>1</m>, <m>3</m>, <m>5</m>, <m>7</m>, and <m>9</m>. This means the domain is the set <m>\{1,3,5,7,9\}</m>.</p>

                <p>Similarly, the ordered pairs tell us that <m>2</m>, <m>-2</m>, <m>-4</m>, and <m>6</m> are possible output values. Notice that the output <m>2</m> happened twice, but it only needs to be listed in this collection once. The range of <m>f</m> is <m>\{2,-2,-4,6\}</m>.</p>

        <title>Determining if a Relation is a Function</title>

        <p>We have seen functions that are defined using a verbal description, using an equation, using a list of ordered pairs, using a table, and using a graph. With all of these things, you might have a relation that is <em>not</em> actually a function. (We have seen a few examples of these as well.) Determining whether or not a given relation actually defines a function is another task that demonstrates actual understanding of the concept of a function.</p>

        <example>
            <title>Verbally Described Relations</title>

            <p>In the introduction, we discussed the relation between the variables of hare population and lynx population. These variables are related<mdash/>for one thing, if the hare population is high, you will have information about the lynx population: it will probably be increasing because there is plenty of food.</p>

            <p>But is this relation a function? Suppose that one year you know the hare population is <m>100{,}000</m> and the lynx population is <m>2000</m>. Isn't it possible that some other year, the hare population is <m>100{,}000</m> again, but the lynx population is something different like <m>3000</m>? Knowing one value of the first variable does not guarantee exactly one value of the second variable. So this relation is not a function.</p>
        </example>

                            <p>The first relation <em>does not</em> represent a function because the input of <m>4</m> is associated with more than one output (<m>3</m> and <m>-5</m>).</p>

        </exercise>

        <p>To determine if a relation that is represented graphically is a function, we need to visually determine if each input corresponds to exactly one output. How could that <em>not</em> happen? Somewhere on the horizontal axis, there would be a number, and looking straight up or straight down from there, you would find at least two points on the graph.</p>

        <p>This thinking gives rise to the <term>vertical line test</term>.</p>

            <p>In <xref ref="figure-graph-not-function">Figure</xref>, we can see that there are vertical lines that pass through the graph more than once. This means that this graph does <em>not</em> represent a function. The issue is that supposing it <em>were</em> a function <m>f</m>, then  what would <m>f(3)</m> be? The graph suggests it could be three different things: <m>\approx1.3</m>, <m>\approx-1.6</m>, and <m>\approx-3.7</m>. With no clear single output for the input <m>3</m>, we don't have a function.</p>

            <p>However, in <xref ref="figure-graph-function">Figure</xref>, we see that all vertical lines pass through the graph one time (or not at all). Therefore, this graph does represent a function. If we name the function <m>g</m>, the domain of <m>g</m> is only numbers greater than or equal to <m>2</m>. And for such numbers, the graphs shows us exactly one output for each input. For example, the graph shows us that <m>g(2)\approx-2.27</m>.</p>
        </example>

        <p>For relations in table form, we can determine if it makes a function by again checking to see if multiple outputs are ever associated with a single input.</p>
