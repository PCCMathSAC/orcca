        <p>A polynomial is a particular type of mathematical expression used for things all around us.<ul>
            <li>
                <p>A company's sales, <m>s</m> (in millions of dollars), can be modeled by <m>2.2t+5.8</m>, where <m>t</m> stands for the number of years since <m>2010</m>.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>The height of an object from the ground, <m>h</m> (in feet), launched upward from the top of a building can be modeled by <m>-16t^2+32t+300</m>, where <m>t</m> represents the amount of time (in seconds) since the launch.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The volume of an open-top box with a square base, <m>V</m> (in cubic inches), can be calculated by <m>30s^2-\frac{1}{2}s^2</m>, where <m>s</m> stands for the length of the square base, and the box sides have to be cut from a certain square piece of metal.</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>All of the expressions above are <term>polynomials</term>. In this section, we will learn some basic vocabulary relating to polynomials and we'll then learn how to add and subtract polynomials.</p>

        <definition xml:id="definition-polynomial"><idx><h>polynomial</h></idx>
             <statement>
                <p>A <term>polynomial</term> is an expression that consists of terms summed together. Each term must be the product of a number and one or more variables raised to whole number powers. Since <m>0</m> is a whole number, a term can just be a number. A polynomial may have just one term. The expression <m>0</m> is also considered a polynomial, with zero terms.</p>
            </statement>
        </definition>
        <p>Some examples of polynomials in one variable are: <me>x^2-5x+2\qquad t^3-1\qquad 7y</me>. The expression <m>3x^4y^3+7xy^2-12xy</m> is an example of a polynomial in several variables.</p>

            <statement>
                <p>A <term>term</term><idx><h>term</h></idx> of a polynomial is the product of a numerical coefficient and one or more variables raised to whole number powers. Since <m>0</m> is a whole number, a term can just be a number.</p>
            </statement>
        </definition>
        <p>For example:<ul>
            <li>
                <p>the polynomial <m>x^2-5x+3</m> has three terms: <m>x^2</m>, <m>-5x</m>, and <m>3</m>;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>the polynomial <m> 3x^4+7xy^2-12xy</m> also has three terms;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>the polynomial <m>t^3-1</m> has two terms.</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>

        <definition xml:id="definition-coefficient"><idx><h>polynomial</h><h>coefficients of</h></idx><idx>coefficient</idx>
            <statement>
                <p>The <term>coefficient</term> (or numerical coefficient) of a term is the numerical factor in the term.</p>
            </statement>
        </definition>
        <p>For example:<ul>
            <li>
                <p>the coefficient of the term <m>\frac{4}{3}x^6</m> is <m>\frac{4}{3}</m>;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>the coefficient of the second term of the polynomial <m>x^2-5x+3</m> is <m>-5</m>;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>the coefficient of the term <m>\frac{y^7}{4}</m> is <m>\frac{1}{4}</m>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>

        <remark>
            <p>Because variables in polynomials must have whole number exponents, a polynomial will never have a variable in the denominator of a fraction or under a square root (or any other radical).</p>

        <definition xml:id="definition-degree"><idx>degree</idx><idx><h>polynomial</h><h>degree of a term</h></idx><idx>degree</idx>
            <statement>
                <p>When a term only has one variable, its <term>degree</term> is the exponent on that variable. When a term has more than on variable, its <term>degree</term> is the sum of the exponents on the variables in that term. When a term has no variables, its <term>degree</term> is <m>0</m>.</p>
            </statement>
        </definition>

        <p>For example:<ul>
            <li>
                <p>the degree of <m>5x^2</m> is <m>2</m>;</p>
            </li>

                <p>the degree of <m>-\frac{4}{7}y^5</m> is <m>5</m>.</p>

            <li>
                <p>the degree of <m>-4x^2y^3</m> is <m>5</m>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>Polynomial terms are often classified by their degree. In doing so, we would refer to <m>5x^2</m> as a second-degree term.</p>

        <definition xml:id="definition-degree-polynomial">
            <statement>
                <p>The <term>degree of a polynomial</term><idx><h>polynomial</h><h>degree of a polynomial</h></idx> is the greatest degree that appears amongst its terms. If the polynomial is just <m>0</m>, it has no terms, and we say its degree is <m>-1</m>.</p>

                <p>The <term>leading term</term><idx><h>polynomial</h><h>leading term</h></idx> of a polynomial is the term with the greatest degree (assuming there is one, and there is no tie).</p>
            </statement>
        </definition>

        <p>For example, the degree of the polynomial <m>x^2-5x+3</m> is <m>2</m> because the terms have degrees <m>2</m>, <m>1</m>, and <m>0</m>, and <m>2</m> is the largest. Its leading term is <m>x^2</m>. Polynomials are often classified by their degree, and we would say that <m>x^2-5x+3</m> is a second-degree polynomial.</p>

        <p>The coefficient of a polynomial's leading term is called the polynomial's <term>leading coefficient</term><idx><h>polynomial</h><h>leading coefficient</h></idx>. For example, the leading coefficient of <m>x^2-5x+3</m> is <m>1</m> (because <m>x^2=1\cdot x^2</m>).</p>

        <definition xml:id="definition-constant-term">
            <statement>
                <p>A term with no variable factor is called a <term>constant term</term><idx><h>constant term</h></idx><idx><h>polynomial</h><h>constant term of</h></idx>.</p>
            </statement>
        </definition>

        <p>For example, the constant term of the polynomial <m>x^2-5x+3</m> is <m>3</m>.</p>

        <p>There are some special names for polynomials with certain degrees:<ul>
            <li>
                <p>A zero-degree polynomial is called a <term>constant polynomial</term> or simply a <term>constant</term>.</p>
                <p>An example is the polynomial <m>7</m>, which has degree zero because it can be viewed as <m>7x^0</m>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A first-degree polynomial is called a <term>linear polynomial</term>.</p>
                <p>An example is <m>-2x+7</m>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A second-degree polynomial is called a <term>quadratic polynomial</term>.</p>
                <p>An example is <m>4x^2-2x+7</m>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A third-degree polynomial is called a <term>cubic polynomial</term>.</p>
                <p>An example is <m>x^3+4x^2-2x+7</m>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>Fourth-degree and fifth-degree polynomials are called quartic and quintic polynomials, respectively. If the degree of the polynomial, <m>n</m>, is greater than five, we'll simply call it an <m>n</m>th-degree polynomial. For example, the polynomial <m>5x^8-4x^5+1</m> is an <m>8</m>th-degree polynomial.</p>

        <remark xml:id="remark-standard-form">
            <p>To help us recognize a polynomial's degree, it is the standard convention to write a polynomial's terms in order from greatest-degree term to lowest-degree term. When a polynomial is written in this order, it is written in <term>standard form</term>. For example, it is standard practice to write <m>7-4x-x^2</m> as <m>-x^2-4x+7</m> since <m>-x^2</m> is the leading term. By writing the polynomial in standard form, we can look at the first term to determine both the polynomial's degree and leading term.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-ketchup-production-costs">
            <title>Production Costs</title>

            <p>Bayani started a company that is devoted to one product: ketchup. The company's production costs only involve two components: supplies and labor. The cost of supplies, <m>S</m> (in thousands of dollars), can be modeled by <m>S=0.05x^2+2x+30</m>, where <m>x</m> is number of thousands of jars of ketchup produced. The labor cost for his employees, <m>L</m> (in thousands of dollars), can be modeled by <m>0.1x^2+4x</m>, where <m>x</m> again represents the number of jars they produce (in thousands of jars). Find a model for the company's total production costs.</p>

            <p>Since Bayani's company only has these two costs, we can find a model for the total production costs, <m>C</m> (in thousands of dollars), by adding the supply costs and the labor costs:<me>C=\left(0.05x^2+2x+30\right)+\left(0.1x^2+4x\right)</me></p>

            <p>To finish simplifying our total production cost model, we'll combine the like terms:<md>
                <mrow>C \amp= 0.05x^2+0.1x^2+2x+4x+30</mrow>
                <mrow> \amp= 0.15x^2+6x+30</mrow>
            </md>This simplified model can now calculate Bayani's total production costs <m>C</m> (in thousands of dollars) when the company produces <m>x</m> thousand jars of ketchup.</p>
        </example>

The revenue, <m>R</m> (in thousands of dollars), from selling the ketchup can be modeled by <m>R=13x</m>, where <m>x</m> stands for the number of thousands of jars of ketchup sold.

        <p>The key distinction between the addition and subtraction of polynomials is that when we subtract a polynomial, we must subtract each term in that polynomial.</p>

        <remark>
            <p>Notice that our first step in simplifying the expression in <xref ref="example-profit-revenue-and-costs">Example</xref> was to subtract <em>every</em> term in the second expression. We can also think of this as distributing a factor of <m>-1</m> across the second polynomial, <m>0.15x^2+6x+30</m>, and then adding these terms as follows:

        <title>Evaluating Polynomial Expressions</title>
        <p>Evaluating expressions was introduced in <xref ref="section-variables-and-evaluating-expressions">Section</xref>, and involves replacing the variable(s) in an expression with specific numbers and calculating the result. Here, we will look at evaluating polynomial expressions.</p>
        <example>
            <statement><p>
                Evaluate the expression <m>-12y^3+4y^2-9y+2</m> for <m>y=-5</m>.
            </p></statement>
            <solution><p>
                We will replace <m>y</m> with <m>-5</m> and simplify the result:
                <md>
                    <mrow>-12y^3+4y^2-9y+2 \amp= -12(\substitute{-5})^3+4(\substitute{-5})^2-9(\substitute{-5})+2 </mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp= -12(-125)+4(25)+45+2</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp= 1647</mrow>
                </md>
            </p></solution>
        </example>

        <remark><p>Recall that <m>(-5)^2</m> and <m>-5^2</m> are not the same expressions. The first expression, <m>(-5)^2</m>, represents the number <m>-5</m> squared, and is <m>(-5)(-5)=25</m>. The second expression, <m>-5^2</m>, is the <em>opposite</em> of the number <m>5</m> squared, and is <m>-5^2=-(5\cdot 5) = -25</m>.</p></remark>

        <example>
            <statement><p>
                Evaluate the expression <m>C=0.15x^2+6x+30</m> from <xref ref="example-ketchup-production-costs">Example</xref> for <m>x=10</m> and explain what this means in context.
            </p></statement>
            <solution><p>
                We will replace <m>x</m> with <m>10</m>:
                <md>
                    <mrow>C\amp=0.15x^2+6x+30</mrow>

                    <mrow>\amp=105</mrow>
                </md>
                In context, we can interpret this as it costing <m>\$105{,}000</m> to produce <m>10{,}000</m> jars of ketchup.
