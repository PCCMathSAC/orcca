          A <term>polynomial</term> is an expression that consists of terms summed together.
          Each term must be the product of a number and one or more variables raised to whole number powers.
          Since <m>0</m> is a whole number,
          a term can just be a number.
          A polynomial may have just one term.
          The expression <m>0</m> is also considered a polynomial,
          with zero terms.

    <p permid="nef">
      Some examples of polynomials in one variable are:

      The expression <m>3x^4y^3+7xy^2-12xy</m> is an example of a polynomial in several variables.
