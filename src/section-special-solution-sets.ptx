  <introduction>
    <p>
      Most of the time after solving a linear equation in one variable, you end with a direct
      statement of what the variable must equal. For example, <m>2x+8=14</m> concludes with
      <m>x=3</m>. There is only one solution, <m>3</m> in this case. Similarly, after solving a
      linear inequality, you typically end with a statement like <m>x\lt5</m>, and the solution set
      is represented with either interval notation like <m>(-\infty,5)</m>, or with set-builder
      notation like <m>\{x\mid x\lt5\}</m>. Visually on a number line, it is either the left half or
      the right half of the number line.
    </p>

    <p>
      Occasionally you will run into a linear equation or inequality that doesn't work this way. A
      linear equation might have many solutions, not just one. Or it might have none at all. An
      inequality might have no solutions, or maybe every number on the number line is a solution. In
      this section we explore these kinds of equation and inequality.
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Special Solution Sets</title>
    <p>
      Recall that for the equation <m>x+2=5</m>, there is only one number which will make the
      equation true: <m>3</m>. This means that the solution is <m>3</m>, and we write the
      <term>solution set</term> as <m>\{3\}</m>. We say the equation's solution set has one
      <term>element</term>, <m>3</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We'll now explore equations where <em>all real numbers</em> are solutions, and other equations
      where <em>no real number</em> is a solution.
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
        Solve for <m>x</m> in <m>3x=3x+4</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To solve this equation, we need to move all terms containing <m>x</m> to one side of the
        equals sign. We set out to remove the <m>3x</m> from the right side of the equation, by
        subtracting <m>3x</m> from each side:
        <md>
          <mrow>3x\amp=3x+4</mrow>
          <mrow>3x\subtractright{3x}\amp=3x+4\subtractright{3x}</mrow>
          <mrow>0\amp=4</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        But now <m>x</m> is no longer present in the equation. Our effort to remove <m>3x</m> from            <idx><h>empty set</h></idx>
        the right side coincidentally removed it from the left side too. What value can we
        substitute in for <m>x</m> to make <m>0=4</m> become true? That's a trick question; you
        could never make <m>0=4</m> become true. We say this equation has no solution. Or we say
        that the equation has an empty solution set. We can write this as <m>\emptyset</m>, or
        <m>\{\text{ }\}</m>, which are the symbols for the <term>empty set</term>. (Be careful not
        to confuse the empty set <m>\emptyset</m> with the number zero, <m>0</m>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The equation <m>0=4</m> isunambiguously false, since it is false no matter what <m>x</m> is.
        It indicates there is no solution to the original equation.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-solving-linear-equation-identity-intro">
      <p>
        Solve for <m>x</m> in <m>2x+1=2x+1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will move all terms containing <m>x</m> to one side of the equals sign:
        <md>
          <mrow>2x+1\amp=2x+1</mrow>
          <mrow>2x+1\subtractright{2x}\amp=2x+1\subtractright{2x}</mrow>
          <mrow>1\amp=1</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Once again, <m>x</m> is no longer present in the equation. What value can we substitute in
        for <m>x</m> to make <m>1=1</m> be true? This is another trick question; <em>any</em> value
        for <m>x</m> would work. This means that all real numbers are solutions to the equation
        <m>2x+1=2x+1</m>. We say this equation's solution set contains <em>all real numbers</em>.
        We can write this set using interval notation as <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>, or use
        <m>\mathbb{R}</m> as an abbreviation for the set of all real numbers.
      </p>

      <p>
        The equation <m>1=1</m> is unambiguously true, since it is true no matter what <m>x</m> is.
        It indicates that all real numbers are solutions to the original linear equation.
      </p>
    </example>

    <remark>
      <p>
        What would have happened if we had continued the solving process after we obtained
        <m>1=1</m> in <xref ref="example-solving-linear-equation-identity-intro">Example</xref>?
        <md>
          <mrow>1\amp=1</mrow>
          <mrow>1\subtractright{1}\amp=1\subtractright{1}</mrow>
          <mrow>0\amp=0</mrow>
        </md>
        All we found was another unambiguously true equation, and we still conclude that all real
        numbers are solutions.
      </p>
    </remark>

    <warning>
      <p>
        Note that there is a very important difference between when our process ends with <m>0=0</m>
        and when it ends with <m>x=0</m>. The first equation is true for all values that <m>x</m>
        might have, and the solution set is <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>. The second situation has only
        one solution, <m>0</m>, and the solution set is <m>\{0\}</m>.
      </p>
    </warning>

    <example>
      <p>
        Solve for <m>t</m> in the inequality <m>4t+5\gt 4t+2</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        To solve for <m>t</m>, we aim to eliminate that <m>4t</m> on the right side by subtracting
        <m>4t</m> from each side:
        <md>
          <mrow>4t+5\amp\gt 4t+2</mrow>
          <mrow>4t+5\subtractright{4t}\amp\gt 4t+2\subtractright{4t}</mrow>
          <mrow>5\amp\gt 2</mrow>
        </md>
        We again find ourselves with the variable completely eliminated from <em>both</em> sides.
        We then try to consider which values of <m>t</m> would make the inequality <m>5\gt 2</m>
        true. The answer is that <em>all values</em> of <m>t</m> make <m>5\gt 2</m>, which we know
        is a strange sounding sentence. So our solution set is all real numbers, which we can write as
        <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m> or <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-solving-linear-inequality-false-statment-intro">
      <p>
        Solve for <m>x</m> in the inequality <m>-5x+1\le -5x</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        To solve for <m>x</m>, we aim to eliminate the <m>5x</m> from the right side by adding
        <m>5x</m> to each side:
        <md>
          <mrow>-5x+1\amp\le -5x</mrow>
          <mrow>-5x+1\addright{5x}\amp\le -5x\addright{5x}</mrow>
          <mrow>1\amp\le 0</mrow>
        </md>
        And yet again, the variable has gone missing. We can ask ourselves, <q>For which values of
        <m>x</m> is <m>1\le 0</m> true?</q> The answer is that this is impossible. There is no
        solution to this inequality. We can write the solution set using <m>\emptyset</m> or just
        say that there are <q>no solutions</q>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p>
      Let's summarize these two special cases that sometimes arise when solving linear equations and
      inequalities.

          <title>All Real Numbers</title>
          <p>
            When solving an equation or inequality boils down to an unambiguously true equation or
            inequality such as <m>2=2</m> or <m>0\lt2</m>, then all real numbers are solutions.
            We write this solution set as <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m> or <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.

        </li>

        <li>
          <title>No Solution</title>
          <p>
            When solving an equation or inequality boils down to an outright false statement such as
            <m>0=2</m> or <m>0\gt2</m>, then no real number is a solution. We write this solution
            set as either <m>\{\ \}</m> or <m>\emptyset</m> or write in words something like
            <q>no solutions</q>.
          </p>

    <title>Further Examples</title>
    <example>
      <p>
        Solve for <m>a</m> in <m>\frac{2}{3}(a+1)-\frac{5}{6}=\frac{2}{3}a</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We recall the technique from <xref ref="section-equations-and-inequalities-with-fractions"/>
        where we clear denominators by multiplying each side of the equation by the least common
        denominator. Here, we will multiply each side by <m>6</m>. After that, we'll be able to
        simplify each side of the equation and continue:
        <md>
          <mrow>\frac{2}{3}(a+1)-\frac{5}{6}\amp=\frac{2}{3}a</mrow>
          <mrow>\multiplyleft{6}\left(\frac{2}{3}(a+1)-\frac{5}{6}\right)\amp=\multiplyleft{6}\frac{2}{3}a</mrow>
          <mrow>\multiplyleft{6}\frac{2}{3}(a+1)-\multiplyleft{6}\frac{5}{6}\amp=\multiplyleft{6}\frac{2}{3}a</mrow>
          <mrow>4(a+1)-5\amp=4a</mrow>
          <mrow>4a+4-5\amp=4a</mrow>
          <mrow>4a-1\amp=4a</mrow>
          <mrow>4a-1\subtractright{4a}\amp=4a\subtractright{4a}</mrow>
          <mrow>-1\amp=0</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
        The statement <m>-1=0</m> is unambiguously false, so the equation has no solution.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example>
      <p>
        Solve for <m>x</m> in the equation <m>3(x+2)-8=(5x+4)-2(x+1)</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A lot could be simplified on each side before continuing, by distributing and combining like
        terms.
        <md>
          <mrow>3(x+2)-8\amp=(5x+4)-2(x+1)</mrow>
          <mrow>3x+6-8\amp=5x+4-2x-2</mrow>
          <mrow>3x-2\amp=3x+2</mrow>
        </md>
        From here, we subtract <m>3x</m> from each side:
        <md>
          <mrow>3x-2\subtractright{3x}\amp=3x+2\subtractright{3x}</mrow>
          <mrow>-2\amp=2</mrow>
        </md>
        As the equation <m>-2=2</m> is outright false, there is no solution to this equation.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example>
      <p>
        Solve for <m>z</m> in the inequality
        <m>\frac{3z}{5}+\frac{1}{2}\le\left(\frac{z}{10}+\frac{3}{4}\right)+\left(\frac{z}{2}-\frac{1}{4}\right)</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We start by multiplying each side of the inequality by the LCD, which is <m>20</m>. Then we
        can continue:
        <md>
          <mrow>\frac{3z}{5}+\frac{1}{2}\amp\le\left(\frac{z}{10}+\frac{3}{4}\right)+\left(\frac{z}{2}-\frac{1}{4}\right)</mrow>
          <mrow>\multiplyleft{20}\left(\frac{3z}{5}+\frac{1}{2}\right)\amp\le \multiplyleft{20}\left(\left(\frac{z}{10}+\frac{3}{4}\right)+\left(\frac{z}{2}-\frac{1}{4}\right)\right)</mrow>
          <mrow>\multiplyleft{20}\left(\frac{3z}{5}\right)+\multiplyleft{20}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\amp\le \multiplyleft{20}\left(\frac{z}{10}+\frac{3}{4}\right)+\multiplyleft{20}\left(\frac{z}{2}-\frac{1}{4}\right)</mrow>
          <mrow>20\cdot\left(\frac{3z}{5}\right)+20\cdot\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\amp\le \multiplyleft{20}\left(\frac{z}{10}\right)+\multiplyleft{20}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)+\multiplyleft{20}\left(\frac{z}{2}\right)-\multiplyleft{20}\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)</mrow>
          <mrow>12z+10\amp\le 2z+15+10z-5</mrow>
          <mrow>12z+10\amp\le 12z+10</mrow>
          <mrow>12z+10\subtractright{12z}\amp\le 12z+10\subtractright{12z}</mrow>
          <mrow>10\amp\le10</mrow>
        </md>
        As the equation <m>10\le10</m> is true for all values of <m>z</m>, all real numbers are
        solutions to the original inequality. So the solution set is <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>, or
        just <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.
