  <introduction permid="dQc">
    <p permid="DcG">
      Most of the time after solving a linear equation in one variable,
      you have an equivalent equation similar to, say <m>x=3</m>,
      that explicitly tells you what value the variable needs to be.
      And there is only one solution,
      <m>3</m> in this case.
      Similarly, after solving a linear inequality,
      you typically have a statement like <m>x\lt5</m>,
      and the solution set is represented with either
      <m>(-\infty,5)</m> in interval notation or
      <m>\{x\mid x\lt5\}</m> in set-builder notation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Occasionally you run into a linear equation or inequality that doesn't work this way.
      A linear equation might have may more solutions than just one.
      Or it might have none at all.
      An inequality might have no solutions,
      or maybe every real number is a solution.
      In this section we explore these equations and inequalities.

      When we say <m>x=1</m> is a solution of the equation <m>x+2=3</m>,
      we imply that when we substitute <m>x</m> with <m>1</m> in the equation <m>x+2=3</m>,
      the equation will be true.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, when we say <m>x=2</m> is not a solution of the equation <m>x+2=3</m>,
      we imply that when we substitute <m>x</m> with <m>2</m> in the equation <m>x+2=3</m>,
      the equation will be false.
    </p> -->

    <p permid="bFq">
      Recall that for the equation <m>x+2=5</m>,
      there is only one number which will make the equation true:
      <m>3</m>.
      This means that the solution is <m>3</m>,
      and we write the <term>solution set</term> as <m>\{3\}</m>.
      We say the equation's solution set has one
      <term>element</term>, <m>3</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="HMz">
      We'll now explore equations that have <em>all</em> real numbers as solutions or <em>no</em> real numbers at all as solutions.
    </p>

    <example permid="WHc">
      <p permid="EhZ">
        Solve for <m>x</m> in <m>3x=3x+4</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="kpi">
        To solve this equation,
        we need to move all terms containing <m>x</m> to one side of the equals sign:
        <md permid="UaR">
          <mrow>3x\amp=3x+4</mrow>
          <mrow>3x\subtractright{3x}\amp=3x+4\subtractright{3x}</mrow>
          <mrow>0\amp=4</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p permid="Qwr">
        Notice that <m>x</m> is no longer present in the equation.
        What value can we substitute into <m>x</m> everywhere that you see <m>x</m> in the equation to make <m>0=4</m> true?
        Nothing! There is no <m>x</m> to substitute a value into and change the equation from being <m>0=4</m>.
        We say this equation has no solution.
        Or, the equation has an empty solution set.
        We can write this as <m>\emptyset</m>, or <m>\{\text{ }\}</m>,
        which are the symbols for the <term>empty set</term><idx><h>empty set</h></idx> (not to be confused with the number <m>0</m>.)
      </p>

      <p permid="wDA">
        The equation <m>0=4</m> is known a
        <term>false statement</term>.
            <idx><h>false statement</h></idx>
        It is false no matter what <m>x</m> is.
        It indicates there is no solution to the original equation.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-solving-linear-equation-identity-intro" permid="COl">
      <p permid="cKJ">
        Solve for <m>x</m> in <m>2x+1=2x+1</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="IRS">
        We will move all terms containing <m>x</m> to one side of the equals sign:

          <mrow>2x+1\amp=2x+1</mrow>
          <mrow>2x+1\subtractright{2x}\amp=2x+1\subtractright{2x}</mrow>
          <mrow>1\amp=1</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p permid="oZb">
        At this point, <m>x</m> is no longer present in the equation.
        What value can we substitute into <m>x</m> to make <m>1=1</m> true?
        Any number!
        This means that all real numbers are solutions to the equation <m>2x+1=2x+1</m>.
        We say this equation's solution set contains
        <em>all real numbers</em>.
        We can write this set using set-builder notation as
        <m>\{x\mid x\text{ is a real number}\}</m> or using interval notation as <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="Vgk">
        The equation <m>1=1</m> is unambiguously true, since it is true no matter what <m>x</m> is.
        It indicates that all real numbers are solutions to the original linear equation.
      </p>
    </example>

    <remark permid="vjM">
      <p permid="qOo">
        What would have happened if we had continued solving after we obtained <m>1=1</m> in <xref ref="example-solving-linear-equation-identity-intro">Example</xref>?
        <md permid="gpj">

          <mrow>0\amp=0</mrow>
        </md>
        As we can see,
        all we found was another unambiguously true equation.
      </p>
    </remark>

    <warning permid="JXl">
      <p permid="YaQ">
        Note that there is a very important difference between when our solving process ends with <m>0=0</m> and when it ends with <m>x=0</m>.
        The first equation is true for all real numbers,
        and the solution set is <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>.
        The second has only one solution, <m>0</m>,
        and the solution set can be written as <m>\{0\}</m>.
      </p>
    </warning>

    <example permid="iVu">
      <p permid="Bnt">
        Solve for <m>t</m> in the inequality <m>4t+5\gt 4t+2</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="huC">
        To solve for <m>t</m>,
        we will first subtract <m>4t</m> from each side to get all terms containing <m>t</m> on one side:
        <md permid="Mws">
          <mrow>4t+5\amp\gt 4t+2</mrow>
          <mrow>4t+5\subtractright{4t}\amp\gt 4t+2\subtractright{4t}</mrow>
          <mrow>5\amp\gt 2</mrow>
        </md>
        Notice that again,
        the variable <m>t</m> is no longer contained in the inequality.
        We then need to consider which values of <m>t</m> make the inequality true.
        The answer is that <em>all values</em> of <m>t</m> make <m>5\gt 2</m>, which we know is a very strange sentence.
        So our solution set is all real numbers,
        which we can write as <m>\{t\mid t\text{ is a real number}\}</m>, or as <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-solving-linear-inequality-false-statment-intro" permid="PcD">
      <p permid="NBL">
        Solve for <m>x</m> in the inequality <m>-5x+1\le -5x</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="tIU">
        To solve for <m>x</m>,
        we will first add <m>5x</m> to each side to get all terms containing <m>x</m> on one side:
        <md permid="sDB">
          <mrow>-5x+1\amp\le -5x</mrow>
          <mrow>-5x+1\addright{5x}\amp\le -5x\addright{5x}</mrow>
          <mrow>1\amp\le 0</mrow>
        </md>
        Once more, the variable <m>x</m> is absent.
        So we can ask ourselves,
        <q>For which values of <m>x</m> is <m>1\le 0</m> true?</q>
        The answer is <em>none</em>,
        and so there is no solution to this inequality.
        We can write the solution set using <m>\emptyset</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <remark permid="bqV">
      <p permid="WVx">
        Again consider what would have happened if we had continued solving after we obtained <m>1\le 0</m> in <xref ref="example-solving-linear-inequality-false-statment-intro">Example</xref>.

        </md>
        As we can see,
        all we found was another false statement<mdash />a different inequality that is not true for any real number.
