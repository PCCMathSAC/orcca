    <p permid="IfT">
      This appendix is mostly intended to review topics from a basic math course,
      especially <xref first="section-arithmetic-with-negative-numbers" last="section-order-of-operations">Sections</xref>.
      These topics are covered differently than they would be covered for a student seeing them for the first time.
