    <title>Finding the Domain of a Rational Function</title>

        <p>Since a rational function is the quotient of two polynomials, there is a possibility that there will be division by zero, which will make the rational expression undefined. This will occur whenever the polynomial in the denominator is equal to zero. Thus, the domain of a rational function will be restricted to all real numbers except for any values of the variable which will make the denominator undefined.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-introduction-to-rational-functions">
            <statement>
                <p>Let <m>f</m> be a function where <m>f(x)=\frac{1}{x-2}</m>. Find the function's domain.</p>
                </statement>

               <solution> <p>By setting the denominator, <m>x-2</m>, equal to zero and solving that equation, we obtain a solution of <m>x=2</m>. This tells us that <m>x=2</m> makes the denominator <m>0</m>, so the function will be undefined for <m>x=2</m>. Therefore, the domain of function <m>f</m> is all real numbers except <m>x=2</m>. In set-builder notation, the domain is <m>\left\{x \mid x\ne2\right\}</m>.</p></solution> 

          
          </example>

            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>To find a rational function's domain, we set the denominator equal to <m>0</m> and solve:<md>
                    <mrow>x^2-2x-24\amp=0</mrow>

                </md>Since <m>x=6</m> and <m>x=-4</m> will cause the denominator to be <m>0</m>, they are excluded from the domain. The function's domain is <m>\left\{x \mid x\ne6, x\ne-4\right\}</m>. </p>

        <title>Simplifying Rational Expressions</title>

        <p>Consider the two rational functions below. At first glance, which function <em>looks</em> simpler?</p>
            <sidebyside widths="47% 47%">
                <p><me>f(x)=\frac{8x^3-12x^2+8x-12}{2x^3-3x^2+10x-15}</me></p>
                <p><me>g(x)=\frac{4(x^2+1)}{x^2+5}, \text{ for }x\neq \frac{3}{2}</me></p>
            </sidebyside>
        <p>It can be argued that the function <m>g</m> is simpler, at least with regard to the ease with which we can determine its domain, quickly evaluate it, and also determine where its function value is zero. All of these things are considerably more difficult with the function <m>f</m>.</p>
        <p>These two functions are actually the <em>same</em> function. Using factoring and the same process of canceling that's used with numerical ratios, we will learn how to simplify the function <m>f</m> into the function <m>g</m>. (The full process for simplifying <m>f(x)=\frac{8x^3-12x^2+8x-12}{2x^3-3x^2+10x-15}</m> will be shown in <xref ref="example-simplify-rational-function">Example</xref>.)</p>
        <p>To see a simple example of the process for simplifying a rational function or expression, let's look at simplifying <m>\frac{14}{21}</m> and <m>\frac{(x+2)(x+7)}{(x+3)(x+7)}</m> by canceling common factors:</p>
            <sidebyside widths="47% 47%">
                <p><md>
                    <mrow>\frac{14}{21}\amp=\frac{2\cdot \cancelhighlight{7}}{3\cdot \cancelhighlight{7}}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp=\frac{2}{3}</mrow>
                </md></p>
                <p><md>
                    <mrow>\frac{(x+2)(x+7)}{(x+3)(x+7)}\amp=\frac{(x+2)\cancelhighlight{(x+7)}}{(x+3)\cancelhighlight{(x+7)}}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp=\frac{x+2}{x+3}, \text{ for }x\neq -7</mrow>
                </md></p>
            </sidebyside>

        <remark><p>
            The statement <q>for <m>x\neq -7</m></q> was added when the factor of <m>x+7</m> was canceled from both the numerator and denominator. This is because <m>\frac{(x+2)(x+7)}{(x+3)(x+7)}</m> was undefined where <m>x=-7</m>, so the simplified version must also be undefined for <m>x=-7</m>.
        </p></remark>

        <remark><p>
            It may be tempting to want to try to simplify <m>\frac{x+2}{x+3}</m> into <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> by canceling each <m>x</m> that appears. These <m>x</m>'s are <em>terms</em> that are added though, and canceling (a process of dividing) is only possible with <em>factors</em>.
        </p></remark>

        <p>The process of canceling factors will be key to simplifying rational expressions and functions. If the expression or function is not given in factored form, then this will be our first step. We'll now look at a few more examples.</p>



 
        <example xml:id="example-simplify-rational-function-simple">
            <statement>
                <p>Simplify the rational function <m>Q(x)=\frac{3x-12}{x^2+x-20}</m> and state the domain of this function.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>To start, we'll factor the numerator and denominator. We'll then cancel any factors common to both the numerator and denominator.<md>

                </md>
            </p>
            <p>The domain of this function will incorporate the <em>explicit</em> domain restriction <m>x\neq 4</m> that was stated when the factor of <m>x-4</m> was canceled from both the numerator and denominator. We will also exclude <m>-5</m> from the domain as this value would make the denominator zero. Thus, the domain of <m>Q</m> is <m>\left\{x\mid x\neq -5,4\right\}</m>.</p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <warning><p>
            When simplifying the function <m>Q</m> in <xref ref="example-simplify-rational-function-simple">Example</xref>, we cannot simply write <m>Q(x)=\frac{3}{x+5}</m>. The reason is that this would result in our simplified version of the function <m>Q</m> having a different domain than the original <m>Q</m>. More specifically, for our original function <m>Q</m> it held that <m>Q(4)</m> was undefined, and this still needs to be true for the simplified form of <m>Q</m>.

Since the factor <m>y-1</m> is still in the denominator, we also need the restriction that <m>y\neq 1</m>. Therefore, the domain of <m>R</m> is <m>\left\{y\mid y\neq -\frac{1}{2},0,1\right\}</m>.</p>

                <p> Note that the expressions <m>3y-x</m> and <m>x-3y</m> are opposites, since they differ by a factor of <m>-1</m>. Binomials that are opposites can be easily identified as being of the form <m>a-b</m> and <m>b-a</m>. By factoring out a factor of <m>-1</m>, this enables us to identify a common factor that can be cancelled, which is what we did in the first step.</p>

<!--         <p>In the example above, notice we moved the negative sign from the numerator to the front of the fraction:<me>\frac{-1}{x+2y}=-\frac{1}{x+2y}</me>To understand why we can do this, let's find a pattern:<md>
            <mrow>\frac{-4}{2}\amp=-2</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{4}{-2}\amp=-2</mrow>
            <mrow>-\frac{4}{2}\amp=-2</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{-4}{-2}\amp=2</mrow>
        </md>We can see:<me>\frac{-4}{2}=\frac{4}{-2}=-\frac{4}{2}</me>This is why we can do <m>\frac{-1}{x+2y}=-\frac{1}{x+2y}</m>.</p>
 -->
<!--         <p>Next, we will also review the sum and difference of cubes formulas:<me>a^3\pm b^3=(a\pm b)(a^2\mp ab+b^2)</me>They are often used when we see perfect cube numbers like <m>1, 8, 27, 64</m> and <m>125</m>.</p>

            <statement>
                <p>Simplify <m>\frac{x^3y^3-27}{12-7xy+x^2y^2}</m></p>
