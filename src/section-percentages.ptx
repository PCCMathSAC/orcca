  <p permid="eho">
    In many situations when translating from English to math,
    the word <q>of</q> translates as multiplication.
    Also the word <q>is</q>
    (and many similar words related to <q>to be</q>)
    translates to an equals sign.
    For example:
    <md permid="nBa">
      <mrow>\text{One third }\amp\text{of thirty is ten.}</mrow>
      <mrow>\frac{1}{3}\amp\cdot30=10</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>

  <p permid="Kox">
    Here is another example, this time involving a percentage.
    We know that <q><m>2</m> is <m>50\%</m> of <m>4</m>,</q> so we can say:
    <md permid="TIj">
      <mrow>2\amp\text{ is } 50\% \text{ of } 4</mrow>
      <mrow>2\amp= 0.5\cdot4</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>

      <p permid="oGt">
        Translate each statement involving percents below into an equation.

        Each question can be translated from English into a math equation by reading it slowly and looking for the right signals.

        <ol label="a." permid="zAX">
          <li permid="Vjb">
            <p permid="qRf">
              The word <q>is</q> means about the same thing as the equals sign.
              <q>How much</q> is a question phrase,
              and we can let <m>x</m> be the unknown amount
              (in dollars).
              The word <q>of</q> translates to multiplication, as discussed earlier.
              So we have:
              <me permid="zPs">
                \pinover{x}{how\ much}\pinover{=}{is}\pinover{0.30}{30\%}\pinover{\cdot}{of}\pinover{24}{\$24}
              </me>

          <li permid="Bqk">
            <p permid="WYo">

              </me>
              With this setup,
              <m>P</m> is going to be a decimal value (<m>0.30</m>) that you would translate into a percentage
              (<m>30\%</m>).
            </p>

          it had already increased.
          So that <m>15\%</m> decrease is going to translate to <em>more</em>
          students lost than were gained.
        </p>

        <p permid="csb">
          Using <m>100\%</m> as corresponding to the enrollment from two years ago,
          the enrollment last year was <m>100\%+15\%=115\%</m> of that.
          But then using <m>100\%</m> as corresponding to the enrollment from last year,
          the enrollment this year was <m>100\%-15\%=85\%</m> of that.
          So we can set up and solve the equation
          <md permid="hLO">
            <mrow>\pinover{x}{this\ \text{year's}\ enrollment}\amp\pinover{=}{is}\pinover{0.85}{85\%}\pinover{\cdot}{of}\pinover{1.15}{115\%}\pinover{\cdot}{of}\pinover{417}{enrollment\ two\ years\ ago}</mrow>
            <mrow>x\amp=0.85\cdot1.15\cdot417</mrow>
            <mrow>x\amp=407.6175</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p permid="Izk">
          We would round and report that enrollment is now <m>408</m> students.
          (The percentage rise and fall of <m>15\%</m> were probably rounded in the first place,
          which is why we did not end up with a whole number.)
