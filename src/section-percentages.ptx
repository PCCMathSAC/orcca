    <introduction>
        <p>Percent-related problems arise in everyday life. This section reviews some basic calculations that can be made with percentages.</p>

        <p>In many situations when translating from English to math, the word <q>of</q> translates as multiplication. Also the word <q>is</q> (and many similar words related to <q>to be</q>) translates to an equals sign. For example:<md>
            <mrow>\text{One third }\amp\text{of thirty is ten.}</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{1}{3}\amp\cdot30=10</mrow>
        </md></p>

        <p>Here is another example, this time involving a percentage. We know that <q><m>2</m> is <m>50\%</m> of <m>4</m>,</q> so we can say:<md>
            <mrow>2\amp\text{ is } 50\% \text{ of } 4</mrow>
            <mrow>2\amp= 0.5\cdot4</mrow>
        </md></p>

        <example xml:id="example-translate-percent-statement-to-equation">
            <statement>
                <p>Translate each statement involving percents below into an equation. Define any variables used. (Solving these equations is an exercise).<ol label="a.">
                    <li>
                        <p>How much is <m>30\%</m> of <m>\$24.00</m>?</p>

                    <li>
                        <p><m>\$7.20</m> is what percent of <m>\$24.00</m>?</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>The word <q>is</q> means about the same thing as the equals sign. <q>How much</q> is a question phrase, and we can let <m>x</m> be the unknown amount (in dollars). The word <q>of</q> translates to multiplication, as discussed earlier. So we have:<me>\pinover{x}{how\ much}\pinover{=}{is}\pinover{0.30}{30\%}\pinover{\cdot}{of}\pinover{24}{\$24}</me></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Let <m>P</m> be the unknown value. We have:<me>\pinover{7.2}{\$7.20}\pinover{=}{is}\pinover{P}{what\ percent}\pinover{\cdot}{of}\pinover{24}{\$24}</me>With this setup, <m>P</m> is going to be a decimal value (<m>0.30</m>) that you would translate into a percentage (<m>30\%</m>).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

        <title>Setting up and Solving Percent Equations</title>

        <p>An important skill for solving percent-related problems is to boil down a complicated word problem into a simple form like <q><m>2</m> is <m>50\%</m> of <m>4</m>.</q> Let's look at some further examples.</p>

        <remark>
            <p>When solving equations that do <em>not</em> have context we state the solution set. However, when solving an equation or inequality that arises in an application problem (such as the context of the high school in <xref ref="example-high-school-classes">Example</xref>), it makes more sense to summarize our result with a sentence, using the context of the application. This allows us to communicate the full result, including appropriate units.</p>

            <statement>
                <p>Carlos just received his monthly paycheck. His gross pay (the amount before taxes and related things are deducted) was <m>\$2{,}346.19</m>, and his total tax and other deductions was <m>\$350.21</m>. The rest was deposited directly into his checking account. What percent of his gross pay went into his checking account?</p>

            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>Train yourself to read the word problem and not try to pick out numbers to substitute into formulas. You may find it helps to read the problem over to yourself three or more times before you attempt to solve it. There are <em>three</em> dollar amounts to discuss in this problem, and many students fall into a trap of using the wrong values in the wrong places. There is the gross pay, the amount that was deducted, and the amount that was deposited. Only two of these have been explicitly written down. We need to use subtraction to find the dollar amount that was deposited:<me>2346.19-350.21=1995.98</me></p>

                <p>Now, we can translate the main question:</p>

                    <p>Let <m>x</m> represent the amount of increase. We can set up and solve the equation:<md>
                        <mrow>\pinover{0.12}{12\%}\pinover{\cdot}{of}\pinover{40}{old\ cost}\amp\pinover{=}{is}\pinover{x}{how\ much}</mrow>
                        <mrow>4.8\amp=x</mrow>
                    </md></p>

                    <p>A full tank now costs <m>\$4.80</m> more than it did last month.</p>
                </solution>
            </webwork>
        </exercise>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>Enrollment at your neighborhood's elementary school two years ago was <m>417</m> children. After a <m>15\%</m> increase last year and a <m>15\%</m> decrease this year, what's the new enrollment?</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>It is tempting to think that increasing by <m>15\%</m> and then decreasing by <m>15\%</m> would bring the enrollment right back to where it started. But the <m>15\%</m> decrease applies to the enrollment <em>after</em> it had already increased. So that <m>15\%</m> decrease is going to translate to <em>more</em> students lost than were gained.</p>

                <p>Using <m>100\%</m> as corresponding to the enrollment from two years ago, the enrollment last year was <m>100\%+15\%=115\%</m> of that. But then using <m>100\%</m> as corresponding to the enrollment from last year, the enrollment this year was <m>100\%-15\%=85\%</m> of that. So we can set up and solve the equation<md>
                    <mrow>\pinover{x}{this\ \text{year's}\ enrollment}\amp\pinover{=}{is}\pinover{0.85}{85\%}\pinover{\cdot}{of}\pinover{1.15}{115\%}\pinover{\cdot}{of}\pinover{417}{enrollment\ two\ years\ ago}</mrow>
                    <mrow>x\amp=0.85\cdot1.15\cdot417</mrow>
                    <mrow>x\amp=407.6175</mrow>
                </md></p>

                <p>We would round and report that enrollment is now <m>408</m> students. (The percentage rise and fall of <m>15\%</m> were probably rounded in the first place, which is why we did not end up with a whole number.)</p>
