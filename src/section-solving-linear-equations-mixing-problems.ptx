      In this subsection,
      we will learn how to solve rate-time-distance application problems.

      he/she would walk <m>2\cdot3=6</m> meters.
      In general, we have the formula

    <title>Investment Application Problems</title>
    <p permid="acL">
      In this subsection,
      we will learn how to solve investment-related application problems.
      To do so, we'll first briefly review how to find a certain percent of a number.
      If we invest <m>\$1{,}000.00</m> in an account that earns <m>5\%</m> interest over a set amount of time,
      the interest we earn over that amount of time will be <m>5\%</m> of <m>$1{,}000</m>.
      To calculate this,
      we will write <m>5\%</m> as a decimal (<m>0.05</m>) and multiply <m>0.05</m> and <m>1000</m>.
      We obtain <m>0.05\cdot1000=50</m>,
      so the amount of interest is <m>\%50</m>.

    <p permid="GjU">
      Expanding on this, if we have <m>x</m> dollars,
      then we can represent <m>5\%</m> of that amount by multiplying <m>0.05</m> and <m>x</m>.

          According to the table, the north campus had <m>100</m> LGBT students,
          and the south campus had <m>500p</m> LGBT students.
          Since the merged campus had <m>130</m> LGBT students,
          we can write and solve this equation:

            <mrow>100+500p\subtractright{100}\amp=130\subtractright{100}</mrow>
            <mrow>500p\amp=30</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{500p}{500}\amp=\frac{30}{500}</mrow>
