    <p>
      In your algebra studies, you have learned how to solve linear equations,
      quadratic equations, and radical equations.
      In this section, we examine some similarities among the processes for solving these equations.
      Understanding these similarities can improve your general equation solving ability,
      even into the future with new equations that are not of these three types.

    <title>Equations Where the Variable Appears Once</title>
    <p>
      Here are some examples of equationst that all have something in common: the variable only appears once.
      <md>
        <mrow>2\attention{x}+1\amp=7\amp(\attention{x}+4)^2\amp=36\amp\sqrt{2\attention{x}-3}=3</mrow>
      </md>
      For equations like this,
      there is a philosophy for solving them that will keep you from overcomplicating things.
      In each case, according to the order of operations, the variable is having some things <q>done</q>
      to it in a specific order.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              then that result is added to <m>1</m>

          <li>

    <p>
      Because there is just one instance of the variable,
      and then things happen to that value in a specific order according to the order of operations,
      then there is a good strategy to solve these equations.
      We can just <em>undo each step in the opposite order</em>.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve the equation <m>2x+1=7</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The actions that happen to <m>x</m> are <em>multiply</em> by <m>2</m>, and then <em>add</em> <m>1</m>.
          So we will do the opposite actions in the opposite order to each side of the equation.
          We will <em>subtract</em> <m>1</m> and then <em>divide</em> by <m>2</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow>2x+1\amp=7\amp\amp\text{now subtract 1 from each side}</mrow>
            <mrow>2x+1\subtractright{1}\amp=7\subtractright{1}</mrow>
            <mrow>2x\amp=6\amp\amp\text{now divide by 2 on each side}</mrow>
            <mrow>\divideunder{2x}{2}\amp=\divideunder{6}{2}</mrow>
            <mrow>x\amp=3</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          You should check this solution by substituting it into the original equation.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <example>

      <solution>
        <p>
          The actions that happen to <m>x</m> are <em>add</em> <m>4</m>, and then <em>square</em>.
          So we will do the opposite actions in the opposite order to each side of the equation.
          We will apply the <xref ref="fact-square-root-property" text="title"/> and then <em>subtract</em> <m>4</m>.

      <solution>
        <p>
          The actions that happen to <m>x</m> are <em>multiply</em> by <m>2</m>, and then <em>subtract</em> <m>3</m>,
          and then apply the square root.
          So we will do the opposite actions in the opposite order to each side of the equation.
          We will <em>square</em> both sides, <em>add</em> <m>3</m> and then <em>divide</em> by <m>2</m>.

    <title>Equations With More Than One Instance of the Variable</title>
    <p>
      Now consider equations like
      <md>
        <mrow>5\attention{x}+1\amp=3\attention{x}+2\amp \attention{x^2}+6\attention{x}\amp=-8\amp\sqrt{\attention{x}-3}=\sqrt{\attention{x}}-1</mrow>
      </md>
      In these examples, the variable appears more than once.
      We can't exactly dive in to the strategy of <em>undoing each step in the opposite order</em>.
      For each of these equations, remind yourself that you can apply any operation you want,
      as long as you apply it to both sides of the equation.
      In many cases, you will find that there is some basic algebra move you can take that will
      turn the equation into something more <q>standard</q> that you know how to work with.

    <sidebyside widths="32% 32% 32%" margins="0%">
      <p>
        With <m>5x+1=3x+2</m>, we have a linear equation.
        If we can simply reorganize the terms to combine like terms,
        a solution will be apparent.
      </p>
      <p>
        With <m>x^2+6x=-8</m>, adding <m>8</m> to both sides would give us a quadratic equation in standard form.
        And then the quadratic formula can be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        With <m>\sqrt{x-3}=\sqrt{x}-1</m>, the complication is those two radicals.
        We can take any action we like as long as we apply it to both sides,
        and <em>squaring</em> both sides would remove at least one radical.
        Maybe after that we will have a simpler equation.

          You should check this solution by substituting it into the original equation.
          It is <em>especially</em> important to do this when the equation was a radical equation.
          At one point, we squared both sides, and this can introduce extraneous solutions (see <xref ref="remark-extraneous-solutions">Remark</xref>).

    <title>Solving For a Variable in Terms of Other Variables</title>
    <p>
      In the examples so far in this section,
      there has been one variable (but possibly more than one instance of that variable).
      This leaves out important situations in science applications where you have a formula
      with <em>multiple</em> variables, and you need to isolate <em>one</em> of them.
      Fortunately these situations are not more difficult than what we have explored so far,
      as long as you can keep track of which variable you are trying to solve for.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In physics, there is a formula for converting a Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit:
          <me>F=\frac{9}{5}C+32</me>
          Solve this equation for <m>C</m> in terms of <m>F</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The variable we are after is <m>C</m>, and that variable only appears once.
          So we will apply the strategy of undoing the things that are happening to <m>C</m>.
          First <m>C</m> is multiplied by <m>\frac{9}{5}</m>,
          and then it is added to <m>32</m>.
          So we will undo these actions in the opposite order: <em>subtract</em> <m>32</m>
          and then multiply by <m>\frac{5}{9}</m> (or <em>divide</em> by <m>\frac{9}{5}</m> if you prefer).
          <md>
            <mrow>F\amp=\frac{9}{5}\attention{C}+32</mrow>
            <mrow>F\subtractright{32}\amp=\frac{9}{5}\attention{C}+32\subtractright{32}</mrow>
            <mrow>F-32\amp=\frac{9}{5}\attention{C}</mrow>
            <mrow>\multiplyleft{\frac{5}{9}}(F-32)\amp=\multiplyleft{\frac{5}{9}}\frac{9}{5}\attention{C}</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{5}{9}(F-32)\amp=\attention{C}</mrow>
            <mrow>C\amp=\frac{5}{9}(F-32)</mrow>

        <p>
          In physics, when an object of mass <m>m</m> is moving with a speed <m>v</m>,
          its <q>kinetic energy</q> <m>E</m> is given by:
          <me>E=\frac{1}{2}mv^2</me>
          Solve this equation for <m>v</m> in terms of the other variables.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The variable we are after is <m>v</m>, and that variable only appears once.
          So we will apply the strategy of undoing the things that are happening to <m>v</m>.
          First <m>v</m> is squared, then it is multiplied by <m>m</m> and by <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>.
          So we will undo these actions in the opposite order: <em>multiply</em> by <m>2</m>,
          <em>divide</em> by <m>m</m>, and apply the square root.
          <md>
            <mrow>E\amp=\frac{1}{2}m\attention{v^2}</mrow>

            <mrow>v\amp=\sqrt{\frac{2E}{m}}</mrow>
          </md>
          At the very end, we chose the positive square root, since a speed <m>v</m> cannot be negative.
          We are satisfied, because we have isolated <m>v</m> in terms of <m>E</m> and <m>m</m>.

          The term <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift">redshift</url><fn>
          <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift</url>

          </fn> for light.
          When an object
          (like a star)
          is moving away from Earth at very fast speeds,
          the wavelength of the light emitted by the star is increased due to the distance between the planets increasing
          (and the constant speed of light).
          Increased wavelength makes light <q>redder.</q>
          The opposite phenomenon is called <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueshift">blueshift</url><fn>
          <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueshift">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueshift</url>
          </fn>.
          There is a formula to calculate the redshift for a star moving away from the Earth:
          <me permid="ZIm">
            f_r=f_s\cdot\sqrt{\frac{c-v}{c+v}}
          </me>
          where <m>c</m> stands for the constant speed of light in a vacuum,
          <m>f_r</m> represents the frequency of the light that the receiver on Earth sees,
          <m>f_s</m> represents the frequency of light that the source star emits,
          and <m>v</m> is the speed that the star moving away from Earth.
          Solve this equation for <m>v</m> in terms of the other variables.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution permid="Wzl">
        <p permid="EvH">
          We have to solve for a variable that appears more than once.
          So we appeal to general algebra skills, doing whatever we like to both sides of the equation,
          trying to make the equation simpler. In this case, we could start by squaring both sides
          to eliminate that radical.
          <md permid="FPv">

          </md>
          Now we scratch our heads a bit,
          wondering what might make the equation simpler.
          The denominator is a significant complcation to this equation.
          Multiplying each side of the equation by <m>(c+v)</m> would clear that away.
          <md>
            <mrow>f_r^2\multiplyright{(c+v)}\amp=f_s^2\cdot\frac{c-\attention{v}}{c+\attention{v}}\multiplyright{(c+v)}</mrow>

          </md>
          All the variables may be distracting, but this is a <em>linear</em> equation in <m>v</m>.
          If we expand the two sides and bring the <m>v</m> terms together,
          we're nearing the end.

            <mrow>f_r^2c+f_r^2\attention{v}\amp=f_s^2c-f_s^2\attention{v}</mrow>

          This formula will tell us the speed of the star away from Earth if we can know the frequency
          of the light when it left the star and the frequency of the light when it reaches Earth.
