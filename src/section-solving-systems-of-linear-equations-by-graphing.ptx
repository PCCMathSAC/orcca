    <introduction>
        <p>We have learned how to graph a line given its equation. In this section, we will learn what a <em>system</em> of <em>two</em> linear equations is, and how to use graphing to solve such a system.</p>

                <p>Fabiana and David are running at constant speeds in parallel lanes on a track. David starts out ahead of Fabiana, but Fabiana is running faster. We want to determine when Fabiana will catch up with David. Let's start by looking at the graph of each runner's distance over time:</p>

            <p>Each of the two lines in <xref ref="figure-solving-systems-by-graphing-intro">Figure</xref> has an equation, as discussed in <xref ref="chapter-graphing-lines">Chapter</xref>. The line representing David appears to have <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0,4)</m> and slope <m>\frac{4}{3}</m>, so its equation is <m>y=\frac{4}{3}t+4</m>. The line representing Fabiana appears to have <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0,0)</m> and slope <m>2</m>, so its equation is <m>y=2t</m>. When these two equations are together as a package, we have what is called a <term>system of linear equations</term><idx><h>system of linear equations</h></idx>:<me>\left\{
                \begin{alignedat}{4}
                y \amp {}={} \frac{4}{3}t \amp {}+{} \amp 4 \\
                y \amp {}={} 2t \\
                \end{alignedat}
                \right.
            </me> The large left brace indicates that this is a collection of two distinct equations, not one equation that was somehow algebraically manipulated into an equivalent equation.</p>

            <p>As we can see in <xref ref="figure-solving-systems-by-graphing-intro">Figure</xref>, the graphs of the two equations cross at the point <m>(6,12)</m>. We refer to the point <m>(6,12)</m> as the <term>solution</term><idx><h>solution</h><h>to a system of linear equations</h></idx> to this system of linear equations. To denote the <term>solution set</term>, we write <m>\{(6,12)\}</m>. But it's much more valuable to interpret these numbers in context whenever possible: it took <m>6</m> seconds for the two runners to meet up, and when they met they were <m>12</m> meters up the track.</p>
        </example>

        <remark>
            <p>In <xref ref="example-solving-systems-by-graphing-intro">Example</xref>, we stated that the solution was the point <m>(6,12)</m>. It makes sense to write this as an ordered pair when we're given a graph. In some cases when we have no graph, particularly when our variables are not <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, it might not be clear which variable <q>comes first</q> and we won't be able to write an ordered pair. Nevertheless, given the context we can write meaningful summary statements.</p>

        <p>Now let's look at an example where <em>we</em> need to make a graph to find the solution.</p>

        <example>
            <p>Solve the following system of equations by graphing:<me>\left\{
                \begin{alignedat}{4}
                y \amp {}={} \amp \frac{1}{2}x \amp {}+{} \amp 4 \\
                y \amp {}={} \amp {-x} \amp {}-{} \amp 5 \\
                \end{alignedat}
            \right.</me></p>

            <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">

                <p>Notice that each of these equations is written in slope-intercept form. The first equation, <m>y=\frac{1}{2}x+4</m>, is a linear equation with a slope of <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> and a <m>y</m>-intercept of <m>(0,4)</m>. The second equation, <m>y=-x-5</m>, is a linear equation with a slope of <m>-1</m> and a <m>y</m>-intercept of <m>(0,-5)</m>. We'll use this information to graph both lines:</p>

            <solution>
                <p>Since both line equations are given in standard form, we'll graph each one by finding the intercepts. Recall that to find the <m>x</m>-intercept of each equation, replace <m>y</m> with <m>0</m> and solve for <m>x</m>. Similarly, to find the <m>y</m>-intercept of each equation, replace <m>x</m> with <m>0</m> and solve for <m>y</m>.</p>

                <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">

                    <p>For our first linear equation, we have:<md>

                        <mrow>\amp\amp y\amp= 4</mrow>
                    </md>. So the <m>x</m>-intercept is <m>(-12,0)</m> and the <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,4)</m>.</p>

                    <p>For our second linear equation, we have:<md>

                <p>It appears that the solution of the system of equations is the point of intersection of those two lines, which is <m>(-3,3)</m>. It's important to check this is correct, because when making a hand-drawn graph, it would be easy to be off by a little bit. To check, we can substitute the values of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> from the point <m>(-3,3)</m> into each equation:<md>
                    <mrow>x-3y \amp=-12\amp 2x+3y \amp= 3</mrow>
                    <mrow>\substitute{-3}-3(\substitute{3}) \amp\stackrel{?}{=}-12 \amp 2(\substitute{-3})+3(\substitute{3}) \amp\stackrel{?}{=} 3</mrow>
                    <mrow>-12\amp\stackrel{\checkmark}{=}-12\amp 3\amp\stackrel{\checkmark}{=}3</mrow>
                </md>So we have checked that <m>(-3,3)</m> is indeed the solution for the system. We write the solution set as <m>\{(-3,3)\}</m>.</p>
            </solution>
        </example>


        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>A college has a north campus and a south campus. The north campus has <m>18{,}000</m> students, and the south campus has <m>4{,}000</m> students. In the past five years, the north campus lost <m>4{,}000</m> students, and the south campus gained <m>3{,}000</m> students. If these trends continue, in how many years would the two campuses have the same number of students? Write and solve a system of equations modeling this problem.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>Since all the given student counts are in the thousands, we make the decision to measure student population in thousands. So for instance, the north campus starts with a student population of <m>18</m> (thousand students).</p>

                <p>The north campus lost <m>4</m> thousand students in <m>5</m> years. So it is losing students at a rate of <m>\frac{4\text{ thousand}}{5\text{ year}}</m>, or <m>\frac{4}{5}\,\frac{\text{thousand}}{\text{year}}</m>. This rate of change should be interpreted as a negative number, because the north campus is losing students over time. So we have a linear model with starting value <m>18</m> thousand students, and a slope of <m>-\frac{4}{5}</m> thousand students per year. In other words, <me>y=-\frac{4}{5}t+18</me>, where <m>y</m> stands for the number of students in thousands, and <m>t</m> stands for the number of years into the future.</p>

                <p>Similarly, the number of students at the south campus can be modeled by <m>y=\frac{3}{5}t+4</m>. Now we have a system of equations:<md>

                    <p>If two linear equations have the same slope and the same <m>y</m>-intercept (in other words, they are equivalent equations), the system has infinitely many solutions. This solution set consists of all ordered pairs on that line.</p>
