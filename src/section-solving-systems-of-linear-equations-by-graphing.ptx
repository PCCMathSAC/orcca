            Fabiana and David are running at constant speeds in parallel lanes on a track.
            David starts out ahead of Fabiana,
            but Fabiana is running faster.
            We want to determine when Fabiana will catch up with David.
            Let's start by looking at the graph of each runner's distance over time,

      <p permid="kvZ">
        As we can see in <xref ref="figure-solving-systems-by-graphing-intro">Figure</xref>,
        the graphs of the two equations cross at the point <m>(6,12)</m>.
        We refer to the point <m>(6,12)</m> as the
        <term>solution</term><idx><h>solution</h><h>to a system of linear equations</h></idx> to this system of linear equations.
        To denote the <term>solution set</term>,
        we write <m>\{(6,12)\}</m>.
        But it's much more valuable to interpret these numbers in context whenever possible:
        it took <m>6</m> seconds for the two runners to meet up,
        and when they met they were <m>12</m> meters up the track.

      <p permid="Xco">
        In <xref ref="example-solving-systems-by-graphing-intro">Example</xref>,
        we stated that the solution was the point <m>(6,12)</m>.
        It makes sense to write this as an ordered pair when we're given a graph.
        In some cases when we have no graph,
        particularly when our variables are not <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>,
        it might not be clear which variable <q>comes first</q>
        and we won't be able to write an ordered pair.
        Nevertheless,
        given the context we can write meaningful summary statements.

          Since all the given student counts are in the thousands,

        <p permid="Aaw">
          The north campus lost <m>4</m> thousand students in <m>5</m> years.

          This rate of change should be interpreted as a negative number,
          because the north campus is losing students over time.
          So we have a linear model with starting value <m>18</m> thousand students,
          and a slope of <m>-\frac{4}{5}</m> thousand students per year.

        This is the literally the same as the first equation in our system.
        This is a different way to show that these two equations are equivalent and represent the same line.
        Any time we try to solve a system where the equations are equivalent,
        we'll have an infinite number of solutions.
