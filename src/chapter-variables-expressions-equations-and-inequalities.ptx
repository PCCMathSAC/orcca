  <title>Variables, Expressions, Equations, and Inequalities</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Algebra helps people solve mathematical problems that are too complicated to solve in your
      head. This book covers basic ideas and skills that people use to be successful with algebra.
      The first things to learn about are variables, algebraic expressions,
      equations, and inequalities.
