    <title>Logarithmic Functions</title>

    <introduction>
		
    	<p>In 2010, a major earthquake struck Haiti, destroying or damaging over 285,000 homes<fn><url href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/today/index.php?month=1&amp;day=12" />. Accessed 8/28/2018.</fn>. One year later, another, stronger earthquake devastated Honshu, Japan, destroying or damaging over 332,000 buildings<fn> <url href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/today/index.php?month=3&amp;day=11&amp;submit=View+DateST" />. Accessed 8/28/2018</fn>. Even though both caused substantial damage, the earthquake in 2011 was 100 times stronger than the earthquake in Haiti. How do we know? The magnitudes of earthquakes are measured on a scale known as the Richter Scale. The Haitian earthquake registered a 7.0 on the Richter Scale, whereas the Japanese earthquake registered a 9.0.</p>

    	<p>The Richter Scale is a base-ten logarithmic scale. In other words, an earthquake of magnitude 8 is not twice as great as an earthquake of magnitude 4. It is <m>{10}^{8-4}={10}^{4}=10,000</m> times as great! In this section, we will investigate the nature of the Richter Scale and the base-ten function upon which it depends.</p></introduction>

    <subsection>
    	<title>Converting from Logarithmic to Exponential Form</title>

    	<p>In order to analyze the magnitude of earthquakes or compare the magnitudes of two different earthquakes, we need to be able to convert between logarithmic and exponential form. For example, suppose the amount of energy released from one earthquake were 500 times greater than the amount of energy released from another. We want to calculate the difference in magnitude. The equation that represents this problem is <m>10^x=500</m>, where <m>x</m> represents the difference in magnitudes on the <term>Richter Scale</term>. How would we solve for<m>x</m>?</p>

    	<p>We have not yet learned a method for solving exponential equations. None of the algebraic tools discussed so far is sufficient to solve <m>10^x=500</m>. We know that <m>10^2=100</m> and <m>10^3=1000</m>, so it is clear that <m>x</m> must be some value between 2 and 3, since, as we learned in <xref ref="section-exponential-functions">Section</xref>, <m>y=10^x</m> is an increasing function.</p>

    	<p>To find an algebraic solution, we must introduce a new function. To represent <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>, we use a logarithmic function of the form <m>y=\mathrm{log}_{b}\left(x\right)</m>. The base <m>b</m> <term>logarithm</term> of a number is the exponent by which we must raise <m>b</m> to get that number.</p>

    	<p>We read a logarithmic expression as, “The logarithm with base <m>b</m> of <m>x</m> is equal to <m>y</m>” or, simplified, “log base <m>b</m> of <m>x</m> is <m>y</m>.” We can also say, “<m>b</m> raised to the power of <m>y</m> is <m>x</m>” because logs are exponents. For example, the base 2 logarithm of 32 is 5, because 5 is the exponent we must apply to 2 to get 32. Since <m>2^5=32</m>, we can write <m>\mathrm{log}_{2}32=5</m>. We read this as “log base <m>2</m> of <m>32</m> is <m>5</m>.”</p>

    	<p>We can express the relationship between logarithmic form and its corresponding exponential form as follows:
		<me>\mathrm{log}_{b}\left(x\right)=y\Longleftrightarrow{b}^{y}=x,b&gt;0,b\ne 1</me></p>

		<p>Note that the base <m>b</m> is always positive.</p>

		<p><figure><image source="images/CNX_Precalc_Figure_04_03_004.jpg"><description>Visual illustration of log base b of x equals y with arrows depicting how to read it.</description></image></figure></p>

		<p>Because a logarithm is a function, it is most correctly written as <m>\mathrm{log}_{b}\left(x\right)</m>, using parentheses to denote function evaluation, just as we would with <m>f\left(x\right)</m>. However, when the input is a single variable or number, it is common to see the parentheses dropped and the expression written without parentheses, as <m>\mathrm{log}_{b}x</m>. Note that many calculators require parentheses around the <m>x</m>.</p>

		<p>We can illustrate the notation of logarithms as follows:

<subsection><title>Converting from Exponential to Logarithmic Form</title>

	<p>To convert from exponents to logarithms, we follow the same steps in reverse. We identify the base <m>b</m>, exponent <m>y</m>, and output <m>x</m>. Then, we write <m>y=\mathrm{log}_{b}\left(x\right)</m>.</p>

	<subsection><title>Evaluating Logarithms</title>

		<p>Knowing the squares, cubes, and roots of numbers allows us to evaluate many logarithms mentally. For example, consider <m>\mathrm{log}_{2}8</m>. We ask, “To what exponent must <m>2</m> be raised in order to get 8?” Because we already know <m>2^3=8</m>, it follows that <m>\mathrm{log}_{2}8=3</m>.</p>

		<p>Now consider solving <m>\mathrm{log}_{7}49</m> and <m>\mathrm{log}_{3}27</m> mentally.</p>

		<p><ul>
			<li><p>We ask, “To what exponent must 7 be raised in order to get 49?” We know <m>7^2=49</m>. Therefore, <m>\mathrm{log}_{7}49=2</m>.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>We ask, “To what exponent must 3 be raised in order to get 27?” We know <m>3^3=27</m>. Therefore, <m>\mathrm{log}_{3}27=3</m>.
			</p></li>
			</ul></p>

		<p>Even some seemingly more complicated logarithms can be evaluated without a calculator. For example, let’s evaluate <m>\mathrm{log}_{\frac{2}{3}}\frac{4}{9}</m> mentally.</p>

		<p><ul>
			<li><p>We ask, “To what exponent must <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> be raised in order to get <m>\frac{4}{9}</m>?” We know <m>2^2=4</m> and <m>3^2=9</m>, so <m>\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2=\frac{4}{9}</m>. Therefore, <m>\mathrm{log}_{\frac{2}{3}}\left(\frac{4}{9}\right)=2</m>.
			</p></li></ul></p>


		<example><title>Solving Logarithms Mentally</title>
			<statement>
				<p>Solve <m>y=\mathrm{log}_{4}\left(64\right)</m> without using a calculator.</p></statement>
			
			<solution>
				<p>First we rewrite the logarithm in exponential form: <m>4^y=64</m>. Next, we ask, “To what exponent must 4 be raised in order to get 64?”</p>
				<p>We know <me>4^3=64</me></p>
				<p>Therefore, <me>\mathrm{log}_{4}\left(64\right)=3</me>, so <m>y=3</m>.</p></solution>
		</example>

		<exercise>
			<statement>
				<p>Solve <m>y=\mathrm{log}_{121}\left(11\right)</m> without using a calculator.</p></statement>
			
			<solution>
				<p>Since <m>\sqrt{121}=(121)^{1/2}=11</m>, <m>y=\mathrm{log}_{121}\left(11\right)=\frac{1}{2}</m>.</p></solution>
		</exercise>


		<example><title>Solving the Logarithm of a Reciprocal</title>
			<statement><p>Solve <m>y=\mathrm{log}_{3}\left(\frac{1}{27}\right)</m> without using a calculator.</p></statement>

			<solution>
				<p>First we rewrite the logarithm in exponential form: <m>3^y=\frac{1}{27}</m>. Next, we ask, “To what exponent must 3 be raised in order to get <m>\frac{1}{27}</m>?”</p>

				<p>We know <m>3^3=27</m>, but what must we do to get the reciprocal <m>\frac{1}{27}</m>? Recall from working with exponents that <m>b^{-n}=\frac{1}{{b}^{n}}</m>. We use this information to write <md>
					<mrow>3^{-3}\amp=\frac{1}{{3}^{3}}</mrow>
					<mrow>\amp=\frac{1}{27}</mrow></md>

				Therefore, <m>y=\mathrm{log}_{3}\left(\frac{1}{27}\right)=-3</m>.</p>
			</solution></example>


			<exercise>
			<statement>
				<p>Solve <m>y=\mathrm{log}_{2}\left(\frac{1}{32}\right)</m> without using a calculator.</p></statement>

				<p><m>y=\mathrm{log}_{2}\left(\frac{1}{32}\right)=-5</m>. So, <m>y=-5</m></p></solution>

<subsection><title>Using Common Logarithms</title>

	<p>Sometimes we may see a logarithm written without a base. In this case, we assume that the base is 10. In other words, the expression <m>\mathrm{log}\left(x\right)</m> means <m>\mathrm{log}_{10}\left(x\right)</m>. We call a base-10 logarithm a <term>common logarithm</term>. Common logarithms are used to measure the Richter Scale mentioned at the beginning of the section. Scales for measuring the brightness of stars and the pH of acids and bases also use common logarithms.</p>

		<p>The most frequently used base for logarithms is <m>e</m>. Base <m>e</m> logarithms are important in calculus and many scientific applications; they are called <term>natural logarithms</term>.

		<p>Most values of <m>\mathrm{ln}\left(x\right)</m> can be found only using a calculator. The major exception is that, because the logarithm of 1 is always 0 for any base, <m>\mathrm{ln}1=0</m>. For other natural logarithms, we can use the <m>\mathrm{ln}</m> key that can be found on most scientific calculators. We can also find the natural logarithm of any power of <m>e</m> using what we've learned so far about the relationsip between logarithm and exponential equations.</p>

				<p>No, the function has no defined value for <m>x=0</m>. To verify, suppose <m>x=0</m> is in the domain of the function <m>f\left(x\right)=\mathrm{log}\left(x\right)</m>. Then there is some number <m>n</m> such that <m>n=\mathrm{log}\left(0\right)</m>. Rewriting as an exponential equation gives: <m>{10}^{n}=0</m>, which is impossible since no such real number <m>n</m> exists.
