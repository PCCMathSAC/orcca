    <introduction>
        <p>Previously, we have learned to multiply monomials in <xref ref="section-exponent-rules">Section</xref> (such as <m>(4xy)\left(3x^2\right)</m>) and to add and subtract polynomials in <xref ref="section-adding-and-subtracting-polynomials">Section</xref> (such as <m>(4x^2-3x)+(5x^2+x-2)</m>). In this section, we will learn how to multiply polynomials.</p>

            <title>Revenue</title>
                <!-- There was an initial intent to thread this example with the production/revenue/profit example from section-adding-and-subtracting-polynomials. The units didn't match though, and in the end that example was changed to ketchup instead of jam, as opposed to aligning the two.-->

            <p>Avery owns a local organic jam company that currently sells about <m>1500</m> jars a month at a price of <m>\$13</m> per jar. Avery has found that every time they raise the price by <m>25</m> cents a jar, they will sell <m>50</m> fewer jars of jam each month.</p>

            <p>In general, this company's revenue can be calculated by multiplying the cost per jar by the total number of jars of jam sold.</p>

            <p>If we let <m>x</m> represent the number of <m>25</m>-cent increases in the price, then the price per jar will be the current price of thirteen dollars/jar plus <m>x</m> times <m>0.25</m> dollars/jar, or <m>13+0.25x</m>.</p>

            <p>Continuing with <m>x</m> representing the number of <m>25</m>-cent increases in the price, we know the company will sell <m>50</m> fewer jars each time the price increases by <m>25</m> cents. The number of jars the company will sell will be the <m>1500</m> they currently sell each month, minus <m>50</m> jars times <m>x</m>, the number of price increases. This gives us the expression <m>1500-50x</m> to represent how many jars the company will sell after <m>x</m> <m>25</m>-cent price increases.</p>

            <p>Combining this, we can now write a formula for our revenue model:<md>
                <mrow>\text{revenue} \amp= \left(\text{price per item}\right)\left(\text{number of items sold}\right)</mrow>
                <mrow>R \amp= \left(13+0.25x\right)\left(1500-50x\right)</mrow>
            </md></p>

            <p>To simplify the expression <m>\left(13+0.25x\right)\left(1500-50x\right)</m>, we'll need to multiply <m>13+0.25x</m> by <m>1500-50x</m>. In this section, we'll learn how to multiply these two expressions that each have multiple terms.</p>

        <title>Review of the Distributive Property</title>

        <p>The first step in almost every polynomial multiplication exercise will be a step of distribution. Let's quickly review the distributive property from <xref ref="section-simplifying-expressions">Section</xref>, which states that <m>a(b+c)=ab+ac</m> where <m>a, b</m>, and <m>c</m> are real numbers or variable expressions.</p>

        <p>When we multiply a monomial with a binomial, we apply this property by distributing the monomial to each term in the binomial. For example,
        <md>
           <mrow>\highlight{-4x}(3x^2+5) \amp= \multiplyleft{(-4x)}(3x^2)+\multiplyleft{(-4x)}(5) </mrow>
           <mrow>    \amp=-12x^3-20x</mrow>
        </md>
        </p>

        <p>A visual approach to the distributive property is to treat the product as finding a rectangle's area. Such rectangles are referred to as <term>generic rectangles</term><idx><h>generic rectangles</h></idx> and they can be used to model polynomial multiplication.</p>

        <p>The big rectangle consists of two smaller rectangles. The big rectangle's area is <m>2x(3x+4)</m>, and the sum of those two smaller rectangles is <m>2x\cdot3x+2x\cdot4</m>. Since the sum of the areas of those two smaller rectangles is the same as the bigger rectangle's area, we have:<md>

            <title>Multiplying Binomials Using Distribution</title>

            <p>Whether we're multiplying a monomial with a polynomial or two larger polynomials together, the first step to carrying out the multiplication is a step of distribution. We'll start with multiplying binomials and then move to working with larger polynomials.</p>

            <p>We know we can distribute the <m>3</m> in <m>(x+2)3</m> to obtain <m>(x+2)\multiplyright{3}=x\multiplyright{3}+2\multiplyright{3}</m>. We can actually distribute anything across <m>(x+2)</m>. For example:
            <me>(x+2)\cat=x\cdot \cat + 2\cdot \cat</me>
            </p>
            <p>With this in mind, we can begin multiplying <m>(x+2)(x+3)</m> by distributing the <m>(x+3)</m> across <m>(x+2)</m>:
                <me>(x+2)\highlight{(x+3)} = x\highlight{(x+3)} + 2\highlight{(x+3)}</me>
            To finish multiplying, we'll continue by distributing again, but this time across <m>(x+3)</m>:
            <md>
                <mrow>(x+2)\highlight{(x+3)} \amp= x\highlight{(x+3)} + 2\highlight{(x+3)}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp= x \cdot x + x \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot x +  2 \cdot 3</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp=x^2+3x+2x+6</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp=x^2+5x+6</mrow>
            </md></p>
            <p>To multiply a binomial by another binomial, we simply had to repeat the step of distribution and simplify the resulting terms. In fact, multiplying any two polynomials will rely upon these same steps.</p>

            <title>Multiplying Binomials Using <acro>FOIL</acro></title>

            <p>While multiplying two binomials requires two applications of the distributive property, people often remember this distribution process using the mnemonic <term><acro>FOIL</acro></term><idx><h><acro>FOIL</acro></h></idx>. <acro>FOIL</acro> refers to the pairs of terms from each binomial that end up distributed to each other.</p>

        <title>Multiplying Polynomials Larger Than Binomials</title>
        <p>The foundation for multiplying any pair of polynomials is distribution and monomial multiplication. Whether we are working with binomials, trinomials, or larger polynomials, the process is fundamentally the same.</p>

            <p>Using the distributive property, we begin by distributing across <m>\left( x^2-4x+6 \right)</m>, perform a second step of distribution, and then combine like terms.
