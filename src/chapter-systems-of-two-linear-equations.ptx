  <title>Systems of Two Linear Equations</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this chapter we study <q>systems</q> where for one reason or another, two line equations
      are relevant at the same time. A system usually has one solution, and we learn various ways to
      find that solution and interpret it when appropriate.
