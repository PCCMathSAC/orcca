        The process of using <m>\sqrt{\phantom{x}}</m> to change numbers might feel more

        Let's continue thinking about <m>\sqrt{\phantom{x}}</m> for now,
        since it's a formula-like symbol that we are familiar with.
        One concern with <m>\sqrt{\phantom{x}}</m> is that although we live in the modern age of computers,
        this symbol is not found on most keyboards.
        And yet computers still tend to be capable of producing square roots.
        Computer technicians write
        <m>\operatorname{sqrt}(\phantom{x})</m> when they want to compute a square root,

      The parentheses are very important.
      To see why, try to put yourself in the
      <q>mind</q> of a computer,
      and look closely at <c>sqrt49</c>.
      The computer will recognize <c>sqrt</c> and know that it needs to compute a square root.
      But computers have myopic vision and they might not see the entire number <m>49</m>.
      A computer might think that it needs to compute <c>sqrt4</c> and then append a <c>9</c> to the end,
      which would produce a final result of <m>29</m>.
      This is probably not what was intended.
      And so the purpose of the parentheses in <c>sqrt(49)</c> is to denote exactly what number needs to be operated on.
    </p>

    <p permid="ikr">
      This demonstrates the standard notation that is used worldwide to write down most functions.
      By having a standard notation for communicating about functions,
      people from all corners of the earth can all communicate mathematics with each other more easily,
      even when they don't speak the same language.
    </p>

    <p permid="OrA">
      Functions have their own names.
      We've seen a function named <m>\operatorname{sqrt}</m>,
      but any name you can imagine is allowable.
      In the sciences, it is common to name functions with whole words,
      like <m>\operatorname{weight}</m> or <m>\operatorname{health\_index}</m>.
      In mathematics,
      we often abbreviate such function names to <m>w</m> or <m>h</m>.
      And of course, since the word <q>function</q>
      itself starts with <q>f,</q>
      we will often name a function <m>f</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="uyJ">
      It's crucial to continue reminding ourselves that functions are
      <em>processes</em> for changing numbers;
      they are not numbers themselves.
      And that means that we have a potential for confusion that we need to stay aware of.
      In some contexts,
      the symbol <m>t</m> might represent a variable<mdash/>a number that is represented by a letter.
      But in other contexts,
      <m>t</m> might represent a function<mdash/>a process for changing numbers into other numbers.
      By staying conscious of the context of an investigation,
      we avoid confusion.
    </p>

    <p permid="aFS">
      Next we need to discuss how we go about using a function's name.

      <statement>
        <p permid="qkp">
          The standard notation for referring to functions involves giving the function itself a name,
          and then writing:
          <me permid="fpL">
            \begin{matrix}
            \text{name}\\
            \text{of}\\
            \text{function}
            \end{matrix}
            \left(
            \begin{matrix}
            \\
            \text{input}\\
            \\

    <example permid="RAo">
      <p permid="iFQ">
        <m>f(13)</m> is pronounced <q>f of 13.</q>
        The word <q>of</q> is very important,
        because it reminds us that <m>f</m> is a process and we are about to apply that process to the input value <m>13</m>.
        So <m>f</m> is the function, <m>13</m> is the input,
        and <m>f(13)</m> is the output we'd get from using <m>13</m> as input.
      </p>

      <p permid="OMZ">
        <m>f(x)</m> is pronounced <q>f of x.</q>
        This is just like the previous example,
        except that the input is not any specific number.
        The value of <m>x</m> could be <m>13</m> or any other number.
        Whatever <m>x</m>'s value,
        <m>f(x)</m> means the corresponding output from the function <m>f</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="uUi">
        <m>\operatorname{BudgetDeficit}(2017)</m> is pronounced
        <q>BudgetDeficit of 2017.</q>
        This is probably about a function that takes a year as input,
        and gives that year's federal budget deficit as output.
        The process here of changing a year into a dollar amount might not involve any mathematical formula,
        but rather looking up information from the Congressional Budget Office's website.
      </p>

      <p permid="bbr">
        <m>\operatorname{Celsius}(F)</m> is pronounced <q>Celsius of F.</q>
        This is probably about a function that takes a Fahrenheit temperature as input and gives the corresponding Celsius temperature as output.
        Maybe a formula is used to do this;
        maybe a chart or some other tool is used to do this.
        Here, <m>\operatorname{Celsius}</m> is the function,
        <m>F</m> is the input variable,
        and <m>\operatorname{Celsius}(F)</m> is the output from the function.
      </p>
    </example>

    <note permid="pVU">
      <p permid="lAw">
        While a function has a name like <m>f</m>,
        and the input to that function often has a variable name like <m>x</m>,
        the expression <m>f(x)</m> represents the output of the function.
        To be clear, <m>f(x)</m> is <em>not</em> a function.
        Rather, <m>f</m> is a function,
        and <m>f(x)</m> its output when the number <m>x</m> was used as input.

        As mentioned earlier,
        we need to remain conscious of the context of any symbol we are using.
        It's possible for <m>f</m> to represent a function (a process),

        Similarly, parentheses might indicate the input of a function,

        It's up to our judgment to interpret algebraic expressions in the right context.

        A number is just a number.
        But a <em>function</em> has the capacity to take in all kinds of different numbers into it's hopper
        (feeding tray)
        as inputs and transform them into their outputs.

      Since functions are potentially complicated,
      we want ways to understand them more easily.
      Two basic tools for understanding a function better are tables and graphs.

        Consider the function <m>\operatorname{BudgetDeficit}</m>,
        that takes a year as its input and outputs the US federal budget deficit for that year.
        For example,
        the Congressional Budget Office's website tells us that
        <m>\operatorname{BudgetDeficit}(2009)</m> is <m>\$1.41</m> trillion.
        If we'd like to understand this function better,
        we might make a table of all the inputs and outputs we can find.
        Using the CBO's website
        (<url href="https://www.cbo.gov/topics/budget">www.cbo.gov/topics/budget</url>),

        the spike in the deficit between 2008 and 2009 is now visually apparent.

        we recall that there was a financial crisis in late 2008.

        Just as in the previous example,
        we've plotted points where we have concrete coordinates,
        and then we have made our best attempt to connect those points with a curve.
        Unlike the previous example,
        here we believe that points will continue to follow the same pattern indefinitely to the right,
        and so we have added an arrowhead to the graph.

        What has this graph done to improve our understanding of <m>\operatorname{sqrt}</m>?
        As inputs (<m>x</m>-values) increase,
        the outputs (<m>y</m>-values) increase too,
        although not at the same rate.
        In fact we can see that our graph is steep on its left,
        and less steep as we move to the right.
        This confirms our earlier observation in <xref ref="example-sqrt-table">Example</xref>
        that outputs increase by smaller and smaller amounts as the input increases.

      <title>Graph of a Function</title>
      <p permid="RHF">
        Given a function <m>f</m>,
        when we refer to a <term>graph of <m>f</m></term> we are <em>not</em>
        referring to an entire picture,
        like <xref ref="figure-sqrt">Figure</xref>.
        A graph of <m>f</m> is only <em>part</em>
        of that picture<mdash/>the curve and the points that it connects.
        Everything else: axes, tick marks, the grid, labels,
        and the surrounding white space is just useful decoration,
        so that we can read the graph more easily.
      </p>

      <p permid="xOO">
        It is also common to refer to the graph of <m>f</m> as the
        <term>graph of the equation <m>y=f(x)</m></term>.
        However, we should avoid saying
        <q>the graph of <m>f(x)</m>.</q>
        That would indicate a fundamental misunderstanding of our notation.
        We have decided that <m>f(x)</m> is the output for a certain input <m>x</m>.
        That means that <m>f(x)</m> is just a number;
        a relatively uninteresting thing compared to <m>f</m> the function,
        and not worthy of a two-dimensional picture.
      </p>
    </note>

    <p permid="Tbt">
      While it is important to be able to make a graph of a function <m>f</m>,
      we also need to be capable of looking at a graph and reading it well.
      A graph of <m>f</m> provides us with helpful specific information about <m>f</m>;
      it tells us what <m>f</m> does to its input values.
      When we were making graphs, we plotted points of the form
      <me permid="LwU">
        (\text{input},\text{output})
      </me>
      Now given a graph of <m>f</m>,
      we interpret coordinates in the same way.

    <example permid="uMR">
      <p permid="wJv">
        In <xref ref="figure-read-graph">Figure</xref>
        we have a graph of a function <m>f</m>.
        If we wish to find <m>f(1)</m>,
        we recognize that <m>1</m> is being used as an input.
        So we would want to find a point of the form <m>(1,\phantom{y})</m>.
        Seeking out <m>x</m>-coordinate <m>1</m> in <xref ref="figure-read-graph">Figure</xref>,
        we find that the only such point is <m>(1,2)</m>.
        Therefore the output for <m>1</m> is <m>2</m>;
        in other words <m>f(1)=2</m>.

        What was the unemployment in 2008?
        It is a straightforward matter to use <xref ref="figure-unemployment">Figure</xref>
        to find that unemployment was about <m>6\%</m> in 2008.
        Asking this question is exactly the same thing as asking to find <m>u(2008)</m>.
        That is, we have one question that can either be asked in an everyday-English way or which can be asked in a terse,
        mathematical notation-heavy way:
      </p>

      <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%" permid="LLc">
        <p permid="Vmf">
          <q>What was unemployment in 2008?</q>

          <q>Find <m>u(2008)</m>.</q>
        </p>
      </sidebyside>

      <p permid="hAx">
        If we use the table to establish that <m>u(2009)\approx9.25</m>,
        then we should be prepared to translate that into everyday-English using the context of the function: In 2009,
        unemployment in the <init>U.S.</init> was about <m>9.25\%</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="NHG">
        If we ask the question <q>when was unemployment at <m>5\%</m>,</q>
        we can read the graph and see that there were two such times:
        mid-2007 and about 2016.
        But there is again a more mathematical notation-heavy way to ask this question.
        Namely, since we are being told that the output of <m>u</m> is <m>5</m>,
        we are being asked to solve the equation <m>u(t)=5</m>.
        So the following communicate the same thing:

    <title>Translating Between Four Descriptions of the Same Function</title>
    <p permid="ziC">
      We have noted that functions are complicated,
      and we want ways to make them easier to understand.
      It's common to find a problem involving a function and not know how to find a solution to that problem.
      Most functions have at least four standard ways to think about them,
      and if we learn how to translate between these four perspectives,
      we often find that one of them makes a given problem easier to solve.

          To make a table for <m>F</m>,

        <statement>
          <p permid="dAy">
            Describe your own example of a function that has real context to it.
            You will need some kind of input variable,
            like <q>number of years since 2000</q>
            or <q>weight of the passengers in my car.</q>
            You will need a process for using that number to bring about a different kind of number.
            The process does not need to involve a formula;
            a verbal description would be great, as would a formula.
          </p>

          <p permid="JHH">
            Give your function a name.
            Write the symbol(s) that you would use to represent input.
            Write the symbol(s) that you would use to represent output.
          </p>
