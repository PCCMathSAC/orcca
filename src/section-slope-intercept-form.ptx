    <introduction>
        <p>In this section, we will explore one of the <q>standard</q> ways to write the equation of a line. It's known as <term>slope-intercept form</term>.</p>        <figure>

    <subsection>
        <title>Slope-Intercept Definition</title>
        <p>Recall <xref ref="example-yaras-savings">Example</xref>, where Yara had <m>\$50</m> in her savings account when the year began, and decided to deposit <m>\$20</m> each week without withdrawing any money. In that example, we model using <m>x</m> to represent how many weeks have passed. After <m>x</m> weeks, Yara has added <m>20x</m> dollars. And since she started with <m>\$50</m>, she has <me>y=20x+50</me> in her account after <m>x</m> weeks. In this example, there is a constant rate of change of <m>20</m> dollars per week, so we call that the <term>slope</term> as discussed in <xref ref="section-slope">Section</xref>. We also saw in <xref ref="figure-yaras-savings">Figure</xref> that plotting Yara's balance over time gives us a straight-line graph.</p>

        <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">
            <p>The graph of Yara's savings has some things in common with almost every straight-line graph. There is a <term>slope</term>, and there is a place where the line crosses the <m>y</m>-axis. <xref ref="figure-generic-slope-intercept">Figure</xref> illustrates this in the abstract.</p>

        <aside>
            <title>What else is there?</title>
            <p>Can you think of a type of straight line that does not have a notion of slope? Or that does not cross the <m>y</m>-axis somewhere?</p>
        </aside>

        <p>We already have an accepted symbol, <m>m</m>, for the slope of a line. The <term><m>y</m>-intercept</term> is a <em>point</em> on the <m>y</m>-axis where the line crosses. <idx><h sortby="y"><m>y</m>-intercept</h></idx><idx><h>intercept</h></idx> Since it's on the <m>y</m>-axis, the <m>x</m>-coordinate of this point is <m>0</m>. It is standard to call the <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0,b)</m> where <m>b</m> represents the position of the <m>y</m>-intercept on the <m>y</m>-axis.</p>

        <p>One way to write the equation for Yara's savings was <me>y=20x+50\text{,}</me> where both <m>m=20</m> and <m>b=50</m> are immediately visible in the equation. Now we are ready to generalize this.</p>

                <solution>
                    <p>In the first three equations, simply read the slope <m>m</m> according to slope-intercept form. The slopes are <m><var name="$m[0]" /></m>, <m><var name="$m[1]" /></m>, and <m><var name="$m[2]" /></m>.</p>
                    <p>The fourth equation was written with the terms not in the slope-intercept form order. It could be written <m>y=-8x+13</m>, and then it is clear that its slope is <m>-8</m>. In any case, the slope is the coefficient of <m>x</m>.</p>
                    <p>The fifth equation is also written with the terms not in the slope-intercept form order. Changing the order of the terms, it could be written <m>y=-\frac{2x}{3}+1</m>, but this still does not match the pattern of slope-intercept form. Considering how fraction multiplication works, <m>\frac{2x}{3}=\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{x}{1}=\frac{2}{3}x</m>. So we can write this equation as <m>y=-\frac{2}{3}x+1</m>, and we see the slope is <m>-\frac{2}{3}</m>.</p>
                    <p>The last two equations could be written <m>y=2x+0</m> and <m>y=0x+3</m>, allowing us to read their slopes as <m>2</m> and <m>0</m>.</p>

                    <p>For the <m>y</m>-intercepts, remember that we are expected to answer using an ordered pair <m>(0,b)</m>, not just a single number <m>b</m>. We can simply read that the first two <m>y</m>-intercepts are  <m><var name="$yi[0]" /></m> and <m><var name="$yi[1]" /></m>.</p>
                    <p>The third equation does not exactly match the slope-intercept form, until you view it as <m>y=\frac{3}{7}x+\left(-\frac{2}{3}\right)</m>, and then you can see that its <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>-\frac{2}{3}</m>.</p>
                    <p>With the fourth equation, after rewriting it as <m>y=-8x+13</m>, we can see that its <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,13)</m>.</p>
                    <p>We already explored rewriting the fifth equation as <m>y=-\frac{2}{3}x+1</m>, where we can see that its <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,1)</m>.</p>
                    <p>The last two equations could be written <m>y=2x+0</m> and <m>y=0x+3</m>, allowing us to read their <m>y</m>-intercepts as <m>(0,0)</m> and <m>(0,3)</m>.</p>
                    <p>Alternatively, we know that <m>y</m>-intercepts happen where <m>x=0</m>, and substituting <m>x=0</m> into each equation gives you the <m>y</m>-value of the <m>y</m>-intercept.</p>
                </solution>
            </webwork>
        </exercise>

        <remark>
            <p>The number <m>b</m> is the <m>y</m>-value when <m>x=0</m>. Therefore it is common to refer to <m>b</m> as the <term>initial value</term> or <term>starting value</term> of a linear relationship.</p>
        </remark>

        <example>
            <p>With a simple equation like <m>y=2x+3</m>, we can see that this is a line whose slope is <m>2</m> and which has initial value <m>3</m>. So starting at <m>y=3</m> when <m>x=0</m> (that is, on the <m>y</m>-axis), each time we increase the <m>x</m>-value by <m>1\text{,}</m> the <m>y</m>-value increases by <m>2\text{.}</m> With these basic observations, we can quickly produce a table and/or a graph.</p>

            <p>To assess whether the relationship is linear, we have to recall from <xref ref="section-exploring-two-variable-data-and-rate-of-change">Section</xref> that we should examine rates of change between data points. Note that the changes in <m>y</m>-values are not consistent. However, the rates of change are calculated as follows:<ul>
                <li>
                    <p>When <m>x</m> increases by <m>2</m>, <m>y</m> increases by <m>6\text{.}</m> The first rate of change is <m>\frac{6}{2}=3\text{.}</m></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>When <m>x</m> increases by <m>3</m>, <m>y</m> increases by <m>9\text{.}</m> The second rate of change is <m>\frac{9}{3}=3\text{.}</m></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>When <m>x</m> increases by <m>4</m>, <m>y</m> increases by <m>12\text{.}</m> The third rate of change is <m>\frac{12}{4}=3\text{.}</m></p>
                </li>
            </ul>Since the rates of change are all the same, <m>3</m>, the relationship is linear and the slope <m>m</m> is <m>3</m>.</p>

            <p>According to the table, when <m>x=0\text{,}</m> <m>y=-4\text{.}</m> So the starting value, <m>b</m>, is <m>-4\text{.}</m></p>

        <title>Graphing Slope-Intercept Equations</title>

        <example>
            <p>The conversion formula for a Celsius temperature into Fahrenheit is <m>F=\frac{9}{5}C+32</m>. This appears to be in slope-intercept form, except that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are replaced with <m>C</m> and <m>F</m>. Suppose you are asked to graph this equation. How will you proceed? You <em>could</em> make a table of values as we do in <xref ref="section-graphing-equations">Section</xref> but that takes time and effort. Since the equation here is in slope-intercept form, there is a nicer way.</p>
            <p>Since this equation is for starting with a Celsius temperature and obtaining a Fahrenheit temperature, it makes sense to let <m>C</m> be the horizontal axis variable and <m>F</m> be the vertical axis variable. Note the slope is <m>\frac{9}{5}</m> and the vertical intercept (here, the <m>F</m>-intercept) is <m>(0,32)</m>.</p>
            <p><ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Set up the axes using an appropriate window and labels. Considering the freezing and boiling temperatures of water, it's reasonable to let <m>C</m> run through at least <m>0</m> to <m>100</m>. Similarly it's reasonable to let <m>F</m> run through at least <m>32</m> to <m>212</m>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Plot the <m>F</m>-intercept, which is at <m>(0,32)</m>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Starting at the <m>F</m>-intercept, use slope triangles to reach the next point. Since our slope is <m>\frac{9}{5}</m>, that suggests a <q>run</q> of <m>5</m> and a <q>rise</q> of <m>9</m> might work. But as <xref ref="figure-slope-intercept-temperature">Figure</xref> indicates, such slope triangles are too tiny. Since <m>\frac{9}{5}=\frac{90}{50}</m>, we can try a <q>run</q> of <m>50</m> and a rise of <m>90</m>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Connect your points with a straight line, use arrowheads, and label the equation.</p>

        <title>Writing a Slope-Intercept Equation Given Two Points</title>
        <p>The idea that any two points uniquely determine a line has been understood for thousands of years in many cultures around the world. Once you have two specific points, there is a straightforward process to find the slope-intercept form of the equation of the line that connects them.</p>
        <example xml:id="example-find-slope-intercept-form-given-points">
            <statement>
                <p>Find the slope-intercept form of the equation of the line that passes through the points <m>(0,5)</m> and <m>(8,-5)</m>.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>We are trying to write down <m>y=mx+b</m>, but with specific numbers for <m>m</m> and <m>b</m>. So the first step is to find the slope, <m>m</m>. To do this, recall the <xref ref="equation-slope-formula" text="title">slope formula</xref> from <xref ref="section-slope">Section</xref>. It says that if a line passes through the points <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2)</m>, then the slope is found by the formula <m>m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</m>.</p>

                <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">
                    <p>Applying this to our two points <m>(\overset{x_1}{0},\overset{y_1}{5})</m> and <m>(\overset{x_2}{8},\overset{y_2}{-5})</m>, we see that the slope is:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>m\amp=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp=\frac{\substitute{-5}-\substitute{5}}{\substitute{8}-\substitute{0}}</mrow>

                        <mrow>\amp=-\frac{5}{4}</mrow>
                    </md></p>

                    <p>We are trying to write <m>y=mx+b</m>. Since we already found the slope, we know that we want to write <m>y=-\frac{5}{4}x+b</m> but we need a specific number for <m>b</m>. We <em>happen</em> to know that one point on this line is <m>(0,5)</m>, which is on the <m>y</m>-axis because its <m>x</m>-value is <m>0</m>. So <m>(0,5)</m> is this line's <m>y</m>-intercept, and therefore <m>b=5</m>. (We're only able to make this conclusion because this point has <m>0</m> for its <m>x</m>-coordinate.) So, our equation is <me>y=-\frac{5}{4}x+5</me>.</p>

            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>The first step is always to find the slope between our two points: <m>(\overset{x_1}{3},\overset{y_1}{-8})</m> and <m>(\overset{x_2}{-6},\overset{y_2}{1})</m>. Using the <xref ref="equation-slope-formula" text="title">slope formula</xref> again, we have:

                <p>Now that we have the slope, we can write <m>y=-1x+b</m>, which simplifies to <m>y=-x+b</m>.

The trick to finding <m>b</m> is to remember that we have two points that we know make the equation true! This means all we have to do is substitute <em>either</em> point into the equation for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> and solve for <m>b</m>. Let's arbitrarily choose <m>(3,-8)</m> to plug in.

        <title>Modeling with Slope-Intercept Form</title>

        <p>We can model many relatively simple relationships using slope-intercept form, and then solve related questions using algebra. Here are a few examples.</p>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>Uber is a ride-sharing company. Its pricing in Portland factors in how much time and how many miles a trip takes. But if you assume that rides average out at a speed of <quantity><mag>30</mag><unit base="mileperhour" /></quantity>, then their pricing scheme boils down to a base of <m>\$7.35</m> for the trip, plus <m>\$3.85</m> per mile. Use a slope-intercept equation and algebra to answer these questions.<ol label="a.">
                    <li><p>How much is the fare if a trip is <m>5.3</m> miles long?</p></li>
                    <li><p>With <m>\$100</m> available to you, how long of a trip can you afford?</p></li>
                </ol></p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>The rate of change (slope) is <m>\$3.85</m> per mile, and the starting value is <m>\$7.35\text{.}</m> So the slope-intercept equation is <me>y=3.85x+7.35\text{.}</me>In this equation, <m>x</m> stands for the number of miles in a trip, and <m>y</m> stands for the amount of money to be charged.</p>

                <p>If a trip is <m>5</m> miles long, we substitute <m>x=5</m> into the equation and we have:<md>
                    <mrow>y\amp=3.85x+7.35</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp=3.85(\substitute{5})+7.35</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp=19.25+7.35</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp=26.60</mrow>
                </md>And the <m>5</m>-mile ride will cost you about <m>\$26.60</m>. (We say <q>about,</q> because this was all assuming you average <quantity><mag>30</mag><unit base="mileperhour" /></quantity>.)</p>

                <p>Next, to find how long of a trip would cost <m>\$100\text{,}</m> we substitute <m>y=100</m> into the equation and solve for <m>x</m>:<md>
                    <mrow>y\amp=3.85x+7.35</mrow>
                    <mrow>\substitute{100}\amp=3.85x+7.35</mrow>
                    <mrow>100\subtractright{7.35}\amp=3.85x</mrow>
                    <mrow>92.65\amp=3.85x</mrow>
                    <mrow>\frac{92.65}{3.85}\amp=x</mrow>
                    <mrow>24.06\amp\approx x</mrow>
                </md>So with <m>\$100</m> you could afford a little more than a <m>24</m>-mile trip.</p>

                <solution>
                    <p>The rate of change (slope) is <m>-30</m> elephants per year. Notice that since we are losing elephants, the slope is a negative number. The starting value is <m>2400</m> elephants. So the slope-intercept equation is<me>y=-30x+2400\text{.}</me>In this equation, <m>x</m> stands for a number of years into the future, and <m>y</m> stands for the elephant population.</p>

                    <p>To estimate the elephant population <m>15</m> years later, we substitute <m>x</m> in the equation with <m>15\text{,}</m> and we have:<md>
                        <mrow>y\amp=-30x+2400</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp=-30(\substitute{15})+2400</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp=-450+2400</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp=1950</mrow>
                    </md>So if the trend continues, there would be <m>1950</m> elephants on this reservation 15 years later.</p>

                    <p>Next, to find when the elephant population would decrease to <m>1200\text{,}</m> we substitute <m>y</m> in the equation with <m>1200\text{,}</m> and solve for <m>x</m>:<md>
                        <mrow>y\amp=-30x+2400</mrow>
                        <mrow>\substitute{1200}\amp=-30x+2400</mrow>
                        <mrow>1200\subtractright{2400}\amp=-30x</mrow>
                        <mrow>-1200\amp=-30x</mrow>
                        <mrow>\frac{-1200}{-30}\amp=x</mrow>
                        <mrow>40\amp=x</mrow>
                    </md>So if the trend continues, <m>40</m> years later, the elephant population would dwindle to <m>1{,}200\text{.}</m></p>
