    <introduction>
        <p>In <xref ref="section-exploring-two-variable-data-and-rate-of-change">Section</xref>, we observed that a constant rate of change between points produces a linear relationship, whose graph is a straight line. Such a constant rate of change has a special name, <term>slope</term>, and we'll explore slope in more depth here.</p>

            <title>Slope</title>
            <idx><h>slope</h></idx>
            <statement>
                <p>When <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are two variables where the rate of change between any two points is always the same, we call this common rate of change the <term>slope</term>. Since having a constant rate of change means the graph will be a straight line, its also called the <term>slope of the line</term>.</p>
            </statement>
        </definition>

        <p>Considering the definition for <xref ref="definition-rate-of-change">Definition</xref>, this means that when <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are two variables where the rate of change between any two points is always the same, then you can calculate slope, <m>m</m>, by finding two distinct data points <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2)</m>, and calculating <men xml:id="equation-slope-definition">m=\frac{\text{change in $y$}}{\text{change in $x$}}=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</men>.</p>

        <p>A slope is a rate of change. So if there are units for the horizontal and vertical variables, then there will be units for the slope. The slope will be measured in <m>\frac{\text{vertical units}}{\text{horizontal units}}</m>.</p>

        <aside>
            <title>Slope <m>m</m></title>
            <p>Why is the letter <m>m</m> commonly used as the symbol for <q>slope?</q> Some believe that it comes from the French word <q>monter</q> which means <q>to climb.</q></p>
        </aside>

        <p>If the slope is nonzero, we say that there is a <term>linear relationship</term> between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.<idx><h>linear relationship</h></idx><idx><h>relationship</h><h>linear</h></idx> When the slope is <m>0</m>, we say that <m>y</m> is <term>constant</term> with respect to <m>x</m>.<idx><h>constant</h></idx></p>

        <p>Here are some scenarios with different slopes. Note that a slope is more meaningful with units.<ul>
            <li>
                <p>If a tree grows <m>2.5</m> feet every year, its rate of change in height is the same from year to year. So the height and time have a linear relationship where the <term>slope</term> is <quantity><mag>2.5</mag><unit base="foot" /><per base="year" /></quantity>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If a company loses <m>2</m> million dollars every year, its rate of change in reserve funds is the same from year to year. So the company's reserve funds and time have a linear relationship where the <term>slope</term> is <m>-2</m> million dollars per year.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If Sakura is an adult who has stopped growing, her rate of change in height is the same from year to year<mdash />it's zero. So the <term>slope</term> is <quantity><mag>0</mag><unit base="inch" /><per base="year" /></quantity>. Sakura's height is <term>constant</term> with respect to time. In a statistics course, you would say that height and time don't have a relationship at all, in the sense that information about Sakura's height tells you nothing about her age.</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>

        <remark>
            <p>A useful phrase for remembering the definition of <term>slope</term> is <q>rise over run.</q><idx><h>rise over run</h></idx> Here, <q>rise</q> refers to <q>change in <m>y</m>,</q> <m>\Delta y</m>, and <q>run</q> refers to <q>change in <m>x</m>,</q> <m>\Delta x</m>. Be careful though. As we have learned, the horizontal direction comes <em>first</em> in mathematics, followed by the vertical direction. The phrase <q>rise over run</q> reverses this. (It's a bit awkward to say, but the phrase <q>run under rise</q> puts the horizontal change first.)</p>
        </remark>

        <example xml:id="example-yaras-savings">
            <title>Yara's Savings</title>

            <p>On Dec.<nbsp/>31, Yara had only <m>\$50</m> in her savings account. For the the new year, she resolved to deposit <m>\$20</m> into her savings account each week, without withdrawing any money from the account.</p>

            <p>Yara keeps her resolution, and her account balance increases steadily by <m>\$20</m> each week. That's a constant rate of change, so her account balance and time have a linear relationship with slope <m>20\, \sfrac{\text{dollars}}{\text{wk}}</m>.</p>

            <p>We can model the balance, <m>y</m>, in Yara's savings account after <m>x</m> weeks with an equation. Since Yara started with <m>\$50</m> and adds <m>\$20</m> each week, the account balance <m>y</m> after <m>x</m> weeks is <men xml:id="equation-yaras-savings">y = 50 + 20x</men> where <m>y</m> is a dollar amount. Notice that the slope, <m>20\, \sfrac{\text{dollars}}{\text{wk}}</m>, serves as the multiplier for <m>x</m> weeks.</p>

            <p>We can also consider Yara's savings using a table.</p>

            <p>In first few rows of the table, we see that when the number of weeks <m>x</m> increases by <m>1</m>, the balance <m>y</m> increases by <m>20</m>. The row-to-row rate of change is <m>\frac{20}{1} = 20</m>, the slope. In any table for a linear relationship, whenever <m>x</m> increases by <m>1</m> unit, <m>y</m> will increase by the slope.</p>

            <p>In further rows, notice that as row-to-row change in <m>x</m> increases, row-to-row change in <m>y</m> increases proportionally to preserve the constant rate of change. Looking at the change in the last two rows of the table, we see <m>x</m> increases by <m>5</m> and <m>y</m> increases by <m>100</m>, which gives a rate of change of <m>\frac{100}{5} = 20</m>, the value of the slope again.</p>

            <p>We can <q>see</q> the rates of change between consecutive rows of the table on a graph of Yara's savings by including <term>slope triangles</term><idx><h>slope</h><h>triangle</h></idx>.</p>

                    <p>Notice that the <em>change</em> in <m>y</m> is negative, because the amount of gas is decreasing. Since we chose points with integer coordinates, we can easily calculate the slope:<me>\text{slope}=\frac{-2}{3}=-\frac{2}{3}\text{.}</me></p>

                <p>With units, the slope is <m>-\frac{2}{3}</m> <quantity><unit base="gallon" /><per base="hour" /></quantity>. In the given context, this slope implies gas in the tank is <em>decreasing</em> at the rate of <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> <quantity><unit base="gallon" /><per base="hour" /></quantity>. Since this slope is written as a fraction, there is another way to understand it: the gas in Kiran's tank is decreasing by <m>2</m> gallons every <m>3</m> hours.</p>

            <p>Effie, Ivan and Cleo are in a foot race. <xref ref="figure-foot-race">Figure</xref> models the distance each has traveled in the first few seconds. Each runner takes a second to accelerate up to their running speed, but then runs at a constant speed. So they are then traveling with a constant rate of change, and the straight line portions of their graphs have a slope. Find each line's slope, and interpret its meaning in this context. What comparisons can you make with these runners?</p>

            <p>Using <xref ref="equation-slope-definition">Formula</xref>, we have:<ul>
                <li>Effie's slope is <m>\frac{8}{3}\approx2.666</m> meters per second</li>
                <li>Ivan's slope is <m>\frac{7}{2}=3.5</m> meters per second</li>
                <li>Cleo's slope is <m>\frac{8}{2}=4</m> meters per second</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p>In a time-distance graph, the slope of a line represents speed. The slopes in these examples and the running speeds of these runners are both measured in <quantity><unit base="meter"/><per base="second"/></quantity>. Another important relationship we can see is that, the more sharply a line is slanted, the bigger the slope is. This should make sense because for each passing second, the faster person travels longer, making a slope triangle's height taller. This means that, numerically, we can tell that Cleo is the fastest runner (and Effie is the slowest) just by comparing the slopes <m>4>3.5>2.666</m>.</p>

        <title>Finding Slope by Two Given Points</title>

        <p>Several times in this section we computed a slope by drawing a slope triangle. That's not really necessary if you have coordinates for two points that a line passes through. In fact, sometimes it's impractical to draw a slope triangle.<fn>For instance if you only have specific information about two points that are too close together to draw a triangle, or if you cannot clearly see precise coordinates where you might start and stop your slope triangle.</fn> Here we will stress how to find a line's slope without drawing a slope triangle.</p>

        <example>
            <p>Your neighbor planted a sapling from <url href="http://portlandnursery.com/">Portland Nursery</url> in his front yard. Ever since, for several years now, it has been growing at a constant rate. By the end of the third year, the tree was <quantity><mag>15</mag><unit base="foot" /></quantity> tall; by the end of the sixth year, the tree was <quantity><mag>27</mag><unit base="foot" /></quantity> tall. What's the tree's rate of growth (<ie /> the slope)?</p>

            <p>We <em>could</em> sketch a graph for this scenario, and include a slope triangle. If we did that, it would look like:</p>

                <p>By the slope triangle and <xref ref="equation-slope-definition">Equation</xref> we have:<md>
                    <mrow>\text{slope}=m\amp =\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp =\frac{12}{3}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp =4</mrow>
                </md>So the tree is growing at a rate of <quantity><mag>4</mag><unit base="foot" /><per base="year" /></quantity>.</p>
            </sidebyside>

            <p>But hold on. Did we really <em>need</em> this picture? The <q>rise</q> of <m>12</m> came from a subtraction of two <m>y</m>-values: <m>27-15</m>. And the <q>run</q> of <m>3</m> came from a subtraction of two <m>x</m>-values: <m>6-3</m>.</p>

            <p>Here is a picture-free approach. We know that after <quantity><mag>3</mag><unit base="year" /></quantity>, the height is <quantity><mag>15</mag><unit base="foot" /></quantity>. As an ordered pair, that information gives us the point <m>(3,15)</m> which we can label as <m>(\overset{x_1}{3},\overset{y_1}{15})</m>. Similarly, the background information tells us to consider <m>(6,27)</m>, which we label as <m>(\overset{x_2}{6},\overset{y_2}{27})</m>. Here, <m>x_1</m> and <m>y_1</m> represent the first point's <m>x</m>-value and <m>y</m>-value, and <m>x_2</m> and <m>y_2</m> represent the second point's <m>x</m>-value and <m>y</m>-value.</p>

            <p>Now we can write an alternative to <xref ref="equation-slope-definition">Equation</xref>:<men xml:id="equation-slope-formula">\text{slope}=m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</men>This is known as the <term>slope formula</term>.<idx><h>slope</h><h>formula</h></idx> The following graph will help you understand why this formula works. Basically, we are still using a slope triangle to calculate the slope.</p>

        <p>It's important to use subscript instead of superscript in the slope equation, because <m>y^2</m> means to take the number <m>y</m> and square it. Whereas <m>y_2</m> tells you that there are at least two <m>y</m>-values in the conversation, and <m>y_2</m> is the second of them.</p>

        <p>The beauty of the <xref ref="equation-slope-formula" text="title">slope formula</xref> is that to find a line's slope, we don't need to draw a slope triangle any more. Let's look at an example.</p>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>A line passes the points <m>(-5,25)</m> and <m>(4,-2)\text{.}</m> Find this line's slope.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>If you are new to this formula, it's important to label each number before using the formula. The two given points are:<me>(\overset{x_1}{-5},\overset{y_1}{25}) \text{ and } (\overset{x_2}{4},\overset{y_2}{-2})</me>Now apply the <xref ref="equation-slope-formula" text="title">slope formula</xref>:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\text{slope}\amp=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp=\frac{-2-25}{4-(-5)}</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp=\frac{-27}{9}</mrow>

                    </md>
                </p>
                <p>Note that we used parentheses when substituting in <m>x_1</m> and <m>y_1</m>. This is a good habit to protect yourself from making errors with subtraction and double negatives.</p>
