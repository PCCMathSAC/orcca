    	<p>A line's point-slope form equation looks like <m>y-y_1=m(x-x_1)\text{,}</m> where <m>m</m> is the line's slope, and <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> is a point on the line. The following figure is an example.</p>

        <p>By the slope triangle, we can see the slope is <m>2</m>, so now the equation looks like <m>y-y_1=2(x-x_1)\text{.}</m> Next, we can pick any point on the line to complete the equation.<ul>
        	<li>If we use the point <m>(0,1)\text{,}</m> the equation would be <m>y-1=2(x-0)\text{,}</m> which can be simplified to <m>y-1=2x\text{.}</m></li>
        	<li>If we use the point <m>(1,3)\text{,}</m> the equation would be <m>y-3=2(x-1)\text{.}</m></li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>We will show why those two equations are equivalent.</p>

        <p>For <m>y-1=2x</m>, we can easily change it to <m>y=2x+1\text{.}</m></p>

        <p>For <m>y-3=2(x-1)\text{,}</m> we can also change it to:<md>
        		<mrow>y-3\amp=2(x-1)</mrow>
        		<mrow>y-3\amp=2x-2</mrow>
        		<mrow>y-3\mathbf{{}+3}\amp=2x-2\mathbf{{}+3}</mrow>
        		<mrow>y\amp=2x+1</mrow>
        </md></p>

        <p>In the graph, we can see the slope is <m>2\text{,}</m> and the <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,1)\text{,}</m> making the slope-intercept equation <m>y=2x+1\text{.}</m> The point-slope form is simply another way to represent the same line.</p>

        <p>Point-slope form is easier to use when we know a line's slope and a point on it, but we don't know the <m>y</m>-intercept. We will look at the same example from last lesson, and solve it in with a point-slope equation.</p>

        <p><em>Scenario:</em> A spa chain has been losing customers at a roughly constant rate since the year 2000. In 2005, it had <m>2,975</m> customers; in 2011, it had <m>2,585</m> customers. Management estimated that the company will close once its customers decrease to <m>2,000\text{.}</m> If this trend continues, when will the company close?</p>

        <p>By the given conditions, we have two points on the line: <m>(5,2975)</m> and <m>(11,2585)\text{.}</m> We will use the slope formula to find the slope. After labeling those two points as <m>(\overset{x_1}{5},\overset{y_1}{2975}) \text{ and } (\overset{x_2}{11},\overset{y_2}{2585})\text{,}</m> we have:<md>
                <mrow>\text{slope}\amp=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp=\frac{2585-2975}{11-5}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp=\frac{-390}{6}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp=-65</mrow>
        </md></p>

        <p>Next, to find the equation in slope-intercept form, we have to substitute <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in <m>y=-65x+b</m> with a point's coordinates, and solve for <m>b\text{.}</m> With point-slope form, our life is much easier:</p>

        <p>Once we found the slope, the point-slope equation is <m>y-y_1=-65(x-x_1)\text{.}</m> Now we can pick one of those two given points, say <m>(5,2975)\text{,}</m> and get the equation<me>y-2975=-65(x-5)</me>and we have found the solution.</p>

        <p>Next, to answer the question, we substitute <m>y</m> in the equation with <m>2000</m> and solve for <m>x\text{,}</m> and we will get the same answer as before. We can see point-slope form has saved us time in solving this problem.</p>

        <p>Even if we later need to use the slope-intercept equation, we can easily convert our point-slope form equation to a slope-intercept one:<md>
        		<mrow>y-2975\amp=-65(x-5)</mrow>
        		<mrow>y-2975\amp=-65x+325</mrow>
        		<mrow>y-2975\mathbf{{}+2975}\amp=-65x+325\mathbf{{}+2975}</mrow>
        		<mrow>y\amp=-65x+3300</mrow>
        </md></p>

        <example>
        	<statement>
        		<p>A line passes <m>(-6,0)</m> and <m>(9,-10)\text{.}</m> Find this line's equation in both point-slope and slope-inercept form.</p>
        	</statement>
        	<solution>
        		<p>We will use the slope formula to find the slope first. After labeling those two points as <m>(\overset{x_1}{-6},\overset{y_1}{0}) \text{ and } (\overset{x_2}{9},\overset{y_2}{-10})\text{,}</m> we have:<md>
		                <mrow>\text{slope}\amp=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp=\frac{-10-0}{9-(-6)}</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp=\frac{-10}{15}</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp=-\frac{2}{3}</mrow>
		        </md></p>

		        <p>Now the equation looks like <m>y-y_1=-\frac{2}{3}(x-x_1)\text{.}</m> Next, we will use <m>(9,-10)</m> and substitute <m>x_1</m> with <m>9</m> and <m>y_1</m> with <m>-10\text{,}</m> and we have:<md>
		                <mrow>y-y_1\amp=-\frac{2}{3}(x-x_1)</mrow>
		                <mrow>y-(-10)\amp=-\frac{2}{3}(x-9)</mrow>
		                <mrow>y+10\amp=-\frac{2}{3}(x-9)</mrow>
		        </md></p>

		        <p>Next, we will change the point-slope equation into slope-intercept form:<md>
		        		<mrow>y+10\amp=-\frac{2}{3}(x-9)</mrow>
		        		<mrow>y+10\amp=-\frac{2}{3}x+6</mrow>
		        		<mrow>y+10\mathbf{{}-10}\amp=-\frac{2}{3}x+6\mathbf{{}-10}</mrow>
		        		<mrow>y\amp=-\frac{2}{3}x-4</mrow>
		        </md></p>
        	</solution>

        <p>We can see Tree 1's equation is <m>y=\frac{2}{3}x+2\text{,}</m> and Tree 2's equation is <m>y=\frac{2}{3}+5\text{.}</m> Tree 1 was <m>2</m> feet tall when it was planted, and Tree 2 was <m>5</m> feet tall when it was planted. Both trees have been growing at the same rate, <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> feet per year, or <m>2</m> feet every <m>3</m> years.</p>

        <p>One important observation is that those two lines are parallel. Why? In <xref ref="section-rate-of-change-and-slope-compare-slopes">Section</xref>, we learned that, for lines with positive slopes, the bigger a line's slope, the more sharply the line is slanted. As a result, if two lines have the same slope, they are slanted at the same angle, thus they are parallel.</p>

        <p>The following video lecture shows how to find a line's equation parallel to another line.</p>

        <figure><video youtube="TrONIeOpJHg" width="70%" /></figure>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>Line A's equation is <m>y=-\frac{5}{6}x-9\text{.}</m> Line B is parallel to Line A, and Line B passes the point <m>(12,4)\text{.}</m> Find Line B's equation.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
            	<p>Since those two lines are parallel, they have the same slope, so Line B's slope is also <m>-\frac{5}{6}\text{.}</m></p>

                <p>We will first find the line's equation in slope-intercept form. Assume Line B's equation is <m>y=-\frac{5}{6}x+b\text{.}</m> To find <m>b</m>'s value, we substitute <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in <m>y=-\frac{5}{6}x+b</m> with <m>(-12,4)</m>'s <m>x</m>-coordinate and <m>y</m>-coordinate, and we have:<md>

                <p>Line B's slope-intercept equation is <m>y=-\frac{5}{6}x-6\text{.}</m></p>

                <p>Next, we will find the line's equation in point-slope form. We will first substitute in the slope, and then substitute in <m>(-12,4)</m>'s coordinates.<md>
                        <mrow>y-y_1\amp=m(x-x_1)</mrow>
                        <mrow>y-y_1\amp=-\frac{5}{6}(x-x_1)</mrow>
                        <mrow>y-4\amp=-\frac{5}{6}[x-(-12)]</mrow>
                        <mrow>y-4\amp=-\frac{5}{6}(x+12)</mrow>
                </md></p>

                <p>On scratch paper, we can check whether those two equations are equivalent:<md>
                        <mrow>y-4\amp=-\frac{5}{6}(x+12)</mrow>
                        <mrow>y-4\amp=-\frac{5}{6}x-10</mrow>
                        <mrow>y\amp=-\frac{5}{6}x-6</mrow>
                </md></p>
