    <p>
      A function is a process for turning input values into output values.
      Occasionally a function <m>f</m> will have input values for which the process breaks down.

    <example xml:id="example-portland-population">
      <p>
        Let <m>P</m> be the population of Portland as a function of the year.
        According to Google<fn>
        <url href="https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=kf7tgg1uo9ude_&amp;met_y=population&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=population&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country&amp;idim=place:4159000&amp;ifdim=country&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false" visual="www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=kf7tgg1uo9ude_&amp;met_y=population&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false &amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=population&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country&amp;idim=place:4159000&amp;ifdim=country &amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false"/>
        </fn> we can say that:
        <md>
          <mrow>P(2016) \amp = 639863 \amp P(1990) \amp= 487849</mrow>
        </md>
        But what if we asked to find <m>P(1600)</m>?
        The question doesn't really make sense anymore.
        The
        <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multnomah_people" visual="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multnomah_people">Multnomah tribe</url>
        lived in villages in the area,
        but the city of Portland was not incorporated until 1851.
        We say that <m>P(1600)</m> is <em>undefined</em>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-weight">
      <p>
        If <m>m</m> is a person's mass in
        <quantity>
          <unit prefix="kilo" base="gram" />
        </quantity>, let <m>w(m)</m> be their weight in
        <quantity>
          <unit base="pound" />
        </quantity>.
        There is an approximate formula for <m>w</m>:
        <me>
          w(m)\approx 2.2m
        </me>
        From this formula we can find:
        <md>
          <mrow>w(50) \amp \approx 110 \amp w(80) \amp \approx 176</mrow>
        </md>
        which tells us that a <m>50</m>-
        <quantity>
          <unit prefix="kilo" base="gram" />
        </quantity>
        person weighs
        <quantity>
          <mag>110</mag><unit base="pound" />
        </quantity>, and an <m>80</m>-
        <quantity>
          <unit prefix="kilo" base="gram" />
        </quantity>
        person weighs
        <quantity>
          <mag>176</mag><unit base="pound" />
        </quantity>.
      </p>

      <p>
        What if we asked for <m>w(-100)</m>?
        In the context of this example,
        we would be asking for the weight of a person whose mass is
        <quantity>
          <mag>-100</mag><unit prefix="kilo" base="gram" />
        </quantity>.
        This is clearly nonsense.
        That means that <m>w(-100)</m> is <em>undefined</em>.
        Note that the <em>context</em> of the example is telling us that <m>w(-100)</m> is undefined even though the formula alone might suggest that <m>w(-100)=-220</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-context-free-domain">
      <p>
        Let <m>g</m> have the formula
        <me>
          g(x)=\frac{x}{x-7}
        </me>.
        For most <m>x</m>-values, <m>g(x)</m> is perfectly computable:
        <md>
          <mrow>g(2) \amp = -\frac{2}{5} \amp g(14) \amp = 2</mrow>
        </md>.
        But if we try to compute <m>g(7)</m>,
        we run into an issue of arithmetic.
        <md>
          <mrow>g(7) \amp = \frac{7}{7-7}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = \frac{7}{0}</mrow>
        </md>
        The expression <m>\frac{7}{0}</m> is <em>undefined</em>.
        There is no number that this could equal.
      </p>
    </example>

    <exercise>
      <webwork>
          <statement>
            <p>
              If <m>f(x)=\dfrac{x+2}{x+8}</m>,
              find an input for <m>f</m> that would cause an undefined output.
            </p>

            <p>
              The number <var name="'-8'" width="5" /> would cause an undefined output.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Trying <m>-8</m> as an input value would not work out;
              it would lead to division by <m>0</m>.
            </p>
          </solution>
      </webwork>

      These examples should motivate the following definition.

      <idx><h>function</h><h>domain</h></idx>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>domain</term> of a function <m>f</m> is the collection of all of its valid input values.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example>
      <p>
        Referring to the functions from <xref first="example-portland-population" last="example-context-free-domain">Examples</xref>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The domain of <m>P</m> is all years starting from 1851 and later.
              It would also be reasonable to say that the domain is actually all years from 1851 up to the current year,
              since we cannot guarantee that Portland will exist forever.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The domain of <m>w</m> is all positive real numbers.
              It is nonsensical to have a person with negative mass or even one with zero mass.
              While there is some lower bound for the smallest mass a person could have,
              and also an upper bound for the largest mass a person could have,
              these boundaries are gray.
              We can say for sure that non-positive numbers should never be used as inputs for <m>w</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              The domain of <m>g</m> is all real numbers except <m>7</m>.
              This is the only number that causes a breakdown in <m>g</m>'s formula.

    <title>Interval, Set, and Set-Builder Notation</title>
    <p>
      Communicating the domain of a function can be wordy.
      In mathematics,
      we can communicate the same information using concise notation that is accepted for use almost everywhere.
      <xref ref="figure-interval-notation">Table</xref>
      contains example functions from this section and their domains,
      and demonstrates <em>interval notation</em> for these domains.
      Basic interval notation is covered in <xref ref="section-comparison-symbols-and-notation-for-intervals">Section</xref>,
      but some of our examples here go beyond what that section covers.

      Again, basic interval notation is covered in <xref ref="section-comparison-symbols-and-notation-for-intervals">Section</xref>,
      but one thing appears in <xref ref="figure-interval-notation">Table</xref>
      that is not explained in that earlier section:
      the <m>\cup</m> symbol, which we see in the domain of <m>g</m>.

      Occasionally there is a need to consider number line pictures such as <xref ref="figure-interval-union">Figure</xref>,
      where two or more intervals appear.

                        \addplot[closedinterval] coordinates {(-5,0) (1,0)};

    <p>
      This picture is trying to tell you to consider numbers that are between <m>-5</m> and <m>1</m>,
      together with numbers that are between <m>4</m> and <m>7</m>.
      That word <q>together</q> is related to the word <q>union,</q>
      and in math the <term>union symbol</term><idx><h>union</h></idx>,
      <m>\cup</m>, captures this idea.
      It means to combine two ideas together, even if they are separate ideas.
      Think of it as putting everything from two baskets into one basket:
      a basket of oranges and a basket of apples combined into one big basket still contains oranges and apples,
      but now it can be thought of as a single idea.
      So we can write the numbers in this picture as
      <me>
        [-5,1]\cup(4,7]
      </me>
      (which uses interval notation).
    </p>

    <p>
      With the domain of <m>g</m> in <xref ref="figure-interval-notation">Table</xref>,
      the number line picture shows us another
      <q>union</q> of two intervals.
      They are very close together,
      but there are still two separated intervals in that picture:
      <m>(-\infty,7)</m> and <m>(7,\infty)</m>.
      Their union is represented by <m>(-\infty,7)\cup(7,\infty)</m>.

      Sometimes we will consider collections of only a short list of numbers.
      In those cases, we use <term>set notation</term>
      (first introduced in <xref ref="section-set-notation-and-types-of-numbers">Section</xref>).
      With set notation, we have a list of numbers in mind,
      and we simply list all of those numbers.
      Curly braces are standard for surrounding the list.
      <xref ref="figure-set-notation">Table</xref>
      illustrates set notation in use.

      While most collections of numbers that we will encounter can be described using a combination of interval notation and set notation,
      there is another commonly used notation that is very useful in algebra:
      <term>set-builder notation</term>,
      which was introduced in <xref ref="section-comparison-symbols-and-notation-for-intervals">Section</xref>.
      Set-builder notation also uses curly braces.
      Set-builder notation provides a template for what a number that is under consideration might look like,
      and then it gives you restrictions on how to use that template.
      A very basic example of set-builder notation is
      <me>
        \{x\mid x\geq3\}
      </me>.
      Verbally, this is <q>the set of all <m>x</m> such that <m>x</m> is greater than or equal to <m>3</m>.</q>
      <xref ref="figure-setbuilder">Table</xref>
      gives more examples of set-builder notation in use.

            Division by zero is undefined.

            it will only be defined where that expression is not equal to zero.

            The square root of a negative number is undefined.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be the function defined by the formula <m>f(x)=x^2</m>.
          Finding <m>f</m>'s <em>domain</em> is straightforward.
          Any number anywhere can be squared to produce an output,
          so <m>f</m> has domain <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>.
          What is the <em>range</em> of <m>f</m>?

          We would like to describe the collection of possible numbers that <m>f</m> can give as output.
          We will use a graphical approach.

        <p>
          To find the domain,
          we can visualize all of the <m>x</m>-values that are valid inputs for this function by <q>sliding the ink</q>
          down onto the <m>x</m>-axis.
          The arrows at the far left and far right of the curve indicate that whatever pattern we see in the graph continues off to the left and right.
          Here, we see that the arms of the graph appear to be tapering down to the <m>x</m>-axis and extending left and right forever.
          Every <m>x</m>-value can be used to get an output for the function,
          so the domain is <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>.

        <p>
          If we visualize the possible <em>outputs</em>
          by <q>sliding the ink</q>
          sideways onto the <m>y</m>-axis,
          we find that outputs as high as <m>3</m> are possible
          (including <m>3</m> itself).
          The outputs appear to get very close to <m>0</m> when <m>x</m> is large,

              The arrows pointing left and right on the curve indicate that whatever pattern we see in the graph continues off to the left and right.

              we try to visualize all of the <m>y</m>-values that are possible outputs for this function.
              Sliding the ink of the curve left/right onto the <m>y</m>-axis reveals that <m>y=0</m> is the only <m>y</m>-value that we could never obtain as an output.
              So the range is <m>(-\infty,0)\cup(0,\infty)</m>.

    <p>
      The examples of finding domain and range so far have all involved either a verbal description of a function,
      a formula for that function, or a graph of that function.
      Recall that there is a fourth perspective on functions: a table.
      In the case of a table,
      we have very limited information about the function's inputs and outputs.
      If the table is all that we have,
      then there are a handful of input values listed in the table for which we know outputs.
      For any other input, the output is undefined.

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the function <m>k</m> given in <xref ref="figure-range-table">Figure</xref>.
          What is the domain and range of <m>k</m>?

          Without any other information such as a formula for <m>k</m> or a context for <m>k</m> that tells us its verbal description,
          we must assume that its domain is <m>\{3,8,10\}</m>;

      <title>Finding Range from a Formula</title>
      <p>
        Sometimes it is possible to find the range of a function using its formula without seeing its graph or a table.
        However, this often requires advanced techniques learned in calculus.
        Therefore when you are asked to find the range of a function based on its formula alone,
        your approach should be to examine a graph.
      </p>
    </warning>

    <p>
      The following examples examine domain and range in context.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          You purchased a house in <m>2010</m> that was valued at <m>\$250{,}000</m>.
          In <m>2015</m>, the value of the house grew to <m>\$300{,}000</m>.
          Finally, in <m>2020</m>, you decided to sell the house.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assume that the value of the house grows at a constant rate.
          Use a function to model the value of this house,
          starting the year you purchased it and ending in the year you sold it.
          Then find this function's domain and range in this context.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Since we know that the value of the house grows at a constant rate,
          the function to model its value must be a linear function.
          We let <m>V(x)</m> denote the value of the house (in dollars) at year <m>x</m>.
          To find the slope for this linear function,
          we apply the <xref ref="equation-slope-formula" text="custom">slope formula</xref>
          with the points <m>(2010,250000)</m> and <m>(2015,300000)</m>
          taken from the given information.
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{300000-250000}{2015-2010}=10000</mrow>
          </md>
          This result tells us that the value of the house grows <m>\$10{,}000</m> per year.
          We can write a formula for <m>V(x)</m> in <xref ref="equation-point-slope-form" text="custom">point-slope form</xref>
          using the slope found above and the point <m>(2015,300000)</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow>V(x)=10000(x-2015)+300000</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since you owned the house from <m>2010</m> to <m>2020</m>,
          the domain (written in interval notation) of the function <m>V</m> is <m>[2010,2020]</m>.
          Therefore, the range for this function must be the output values from <m>V(2010)</m> to <m>V(2020)</m>.
          We already know however that <m>V(2010)=250000</m> from the information given above.
          Thus we only need to calculate <m>V(2020)</m> below.
          <md>
            <mrow>V(\substitute{2020})\amp=10000(\substitute{2020}-2015)+300000</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=350000</mrow>
          </md>
          Thus, the range (written in interval notation) of the function is <m>[250000,350000]</m>.
        </p>
        <sidebyside>
          <p>
            We can confirm these results by graphing the function within the domain <m>[2010,2020]</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          A ball is thrown from the top of a <m>35</m> foot tall building at an intitial vertical speed of <m>65</m> feet per second.
          In its flight, the ball misses the building and continue downward until it hits ground.
          The height <m>H(t)</m>, in feet, at <m>t</m> seconds after it was thrown is given by <m>H(t)=-16t^2+65t+35</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Find the domain and range of this function in the context of this situation.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We observe that <m>t=0</m> seconds is the first valid input value.
          To find the final input value we need to find the time <m>t</m> when the ball hits the ground.
          That is, we need to solve <m>H(t)=0</m> for <m>t</m>.
          This equation gives <m>-16t^2+65t+35=0</m>,
          which we solve using the <xref ref="fact-the-quadratic-formula" text="custom">quadratic formula</xref>.
          <md>
            <mrow>t\amp=\frac{-65\pm\sqrt{65^2-4(-16)(35)}}{2(-16)}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=\frac{-65\pm\sqrt{4225+2240)}}{-32}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=\frac{-65\pm\sqrt{6465}}{-32}</mrow>
            <mrow>t\amp\approx-0.4814\quad\text{or}\quad t\approx4.544</mrow>
          </md>
          We ignore the negative solution since that is a time from before the ball was thrown.
          So the final valid input value must be <m>t\approx4.544</m> seconds.
          Therefore the domain (in interval notation) of the function is approximately <m>[0,4.544]</m>.
          (The <q>4.544</q> is really <m>\frac{-65-\sqrt{6465}}{-32}</m>.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The range of this function must be from the <em>minimum height</em> of the ball's flight to its <em>maximum height</em>.
          We already know that minimum height is <m>0</m> feet since the ball eventually hits the ground.
          We know that the graph of <m>H</m> forms a downward opening parabola,
          since <m>H</m> is a quadratic function with leading coefficient <m>-16</m>, which is negative.
          So the vertex of the parabola will tell us the maximum height.
          We find the vertex <m>(h,k)</m> using the <xref ref="fact-vertex" text="custom">vertex formula</xref>.
          <md>
            <mrow>h\amp=-\frac{b}{2a}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=-\frac{\substitute{65}}{2(\substitute{-16})}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=\frac{65}{32}\approx2.031</mrow>
            <mrow>k\amp=H\mathopen{}\left(\substitute{\frac{65}{32}}\right)\mathclose{}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=-16\left(\frac{65}{32}\right)^2+65\left(\frac{65}{32}\right)+35\approx101</mrow>
          </md>
          Therefore, the range (in interval notation) of the function is approximately <m>[0,101]</m>.
        </p>
        <sidebyside>
          <p>
            We can confirm our results by graphing the function within the domain <m>[0,4.544]</m>.
