   <subsection>
    <title>Solving Equations for Geometry Problems</title>
    <p>
      With geometry problems in algebra,
      it is really helpful to draw a picture to understand the scenario better.
      After drawing the shape and labeling the given information, we will choose the formula to use from the list in <xref ref="subsection-list-of-geometry-formulas">Subsection</xref>.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An Olympic-size swimming pool is rectangular and
          <quantity>
            <mag>50</mag><unit base="meter" />
          </quantity>
          in length.
          We don't know its width, but we do know that it required
          <quantity>
            <mag>150</mag><unit base="meter" />
          </quantity>
          of painter's tape to outline the edge of the pool during recent renovations.
          Use this information to set up an equation and find the width of the pool.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <sidebyside widths="59% 35%" margins="0%">
          <p>
            The pool's shape is a rectangle, so
            it helps to sketch a rectangle representing the pool as in <xref ref="figure-olympic-pool">Figure</xref>.
            Since we know its length is
            <quantity>
              <mag>50</mag><unit base="meter" />
            </quantity>, it is a good idea to label that in the sketch.
            The width is our unknown quantity,
            so we can use <m>w</m> as a variable to represent the pool's width in meters and label that too.
          </p>

          <figure xml:id="figure-olympic-pool">
            <caption>An Olympic-size pool</caption>
            <image>

            <latex-image>
                \begin{tikzpicture}[x=1mm,y=1mm]
                    \draw[fill=blue!60!green!40!white] (0,0) rectangle (50,25);
                    \node[below] at (25,0) {$50$};
                    \node[right] at (50,12.5) {$w$};
                \end{tikzpicture}
            </latex-image>
            </image>

          </figure>
        </sidebyside>

        <p>
          Since it required
          <quantity>
            <mag>150</mag><unit base="meter" />
          </quantity>
          of painter's tape to outline the pool,
          we know the perimeter of the pool is
          <quantity>
            <mag>150</mag><unit base="meter" />
          </quantity>.
          This suggests using the perimeter formula for a rectangle:
          <m>P=2(\ell+w)</m>. (This formula was discussed in <xref ref="subsection-perimeter-and-area">Subsection</xref>).
        </p>

        <p>
          With this formula,
          we can substitute <m>150</m> in for <m>P</m> and <m>50</m> in for <m>\ell</m>:
          <me>
            150=2(50+w).
          </me>
          Now we can solve the equation for the width of the pool.
        </p>

        <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">
          <p>
            First, we will distribute on the right side, and then isolate <m>w</m>.

          <statement>
            <p>
              One sail on a sail boat is approximately shaped like a triangle.
              If the base length is <m>10</m> feet and the total sail area is <m>125</m> square feet,
              we can wonder how tall is the sail.
              Set up an equation to model the sail's height.
            </p>
            <instruction>
              Use <c>h</c> as the variable representing the sail's height.

            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Since the sail's shape is (approximately) a triangle,
              it helps to sketch a triangle representing the sail.
              Since we know its base width is <m>10</m> feet,
              it is a good idea to label that in the sketch.
              The heigth is our unknown quantity,
              so we can use <m>h</m> as a variable to represent the sail's height in feet and label that too.
            </p>

            <image pg-name="$triangle" width="8%"/>

            <p>
              Since the total area is known to be <m>125</m> square feet,
              this suggests using the area formula for a triangle:
              <m>A=\frac{1}{2}bh</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              With this formula,
              we can substitute <m>125</m> in for <m>A</m> and <m>100</m> in for <m>b</m>:
              <me>
                125=\frac{1}{2}(10)h
              </me>
              and this equation models the height of the pool.

      Let's look at another example. In this one we need to use an algebraic expression for one of the sides of a rectangle.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Azul is designing a rectangular garden and they have <m>40</m> meters of wood planking for the border.
          Their garden's length is <m>4</m> meters less than three times the width,
          and the perimeter must be <m>40</m> meters.
          Find the garden's length and width.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Let Azul's garden width be <m>w</m> meters.
          We can then represent the length as <m>3w-4</m> meters since we are told that it is <m>4</m> meters less than three times the width.
          It's given that the perimeter is <m>40</m> meters.
          Substituting those values into the formula, we have:
          <md>
            <mrow>P\amp=2(\ell+w)</mrow>
            <mrow>40\amp=2(3w-4+w)</mrow>

        <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">
          <p>
            The next step to solve this equation is to remove the parentheses by distribution.

          <p>
            Checking the solution <m>w=6</m>:

            </md>.
          </p>
        </sidebyside>

        <p>
          To determine the length,
          recall that this was represented by <m>3w-4</m>, which is:
          <md>
            <mrow>3w-4\amp=3(\substitute{6})-4</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=14</mrow>
          </md>.
          Thus, the width of Azul's garden is <m>6</m> meters and the length is <m>14</m> meters.
        </p>
      </solution>

    <exercise>
      <webwork source="Contrib/PCC/BasicAlgebra/Geometry/RectanglePerimeterEquation10.pg" />
    </exercise>

    <p>
      For triangle problems, we may need to use the Pythagorean Theorem that we learned in <xref ref="subsection-pythagorean-theorem">Subsection</xref>. If we know the lengths of two sides of a right triangle then we can find the length of the third side.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Tan owns a road sign manufacturing company and he is producing triangular yield signs for the State of Oregon. The signs are equilateral triangles measuring <m>36</m> inches on each side
          as shown in <xref ref="figure-triangular-sign">Figure</xref>. Find the area of one sign in square feet to help Tan estimate the amount of material he needs to produce the signs.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          We will start by converting <m>36</m> inches to <m>3</m> feet, because the area needs to be in square feet.
          The area of a triangle is found using <m>A=\frac{1}{2}bh</m>,
          where <m>A</m> is the area, <m>b</m> is the width of the base, and
          <m>h</m> is the height. In this case the base is at the top of the triangle.
        </p>
        <p>
          We know the width of the triangle is <m>3</m> feet, but we don't know the height. By drawing in the height we form two right triangles so we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the height. Half of the width is <m>1.5</m> feet, so we will substitute for <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> in the pythagorean theorem.
        </p>

          Batula wants to order a custom replacement column for the front of her house and she needs to know the radius. She takes a string and wraps it around the old column. She measures the string and finds the circumference is <m>3</m> feet, <m>2.5</m> inches. What is the radius of the column?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The formula for the circumference of a circle is <m>C=2\pi r</m>,
          where <m>C</m> stands for the circumference and
          <m>r</m> stands for the radius.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will let the radius of Batula's column be <m>r</m> inches.
          It's given that the circumference is <m>3</m> feet, <m>2.5</m> inches, so let's convert <m>3</m> feet into inches.
          <md>
              <mrow>3\,\text{ft}\amp=\frac{3\,\text{ft}}{1}\cdot\frac{12\,\text{in}}{1\,\text{ft}}</mrow>
              <!-- todo: these \cancel commands aren't rendering properly -->
              <mrow>\amp=\frac{3\,\cancel{\text{ft}}}{1}\cdot\frac{12\,\text{in}}{1\,\cancel{\text{ft}}}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp=3\cdot12\,\text{in}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp=36\,\text{in}</mrow>
            </md>

          Since <m>3</m> feet is <m>36</m> inches, we can add the <m>2.5</m> inches for a total of <m>38.5</m> inches. Substituting the circumference into the formula, we have:
          <md>
            <mrow>C\amp=2\pi r</mrow>
            <mrow>38.5\amp=2\pi r</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">
          <p>
            The next step is to divide both sides by <m>2\pi</m>.
            <md>
              <mrow>38.5\amp=2\pi r</mrow>
              <mrow>\divideunder{38.5}{2\pi}\amp=\divideunder{2\pi r}{2\pi}</mrow>
              <mrow>6.127\amp\approx r</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Checking the solution <m>r\approx6.13</m> inches:
            <md>
              <mrow>38.5\amp=2\pi r</mrow>
              <mrow>38.5\amp\wonder{\approx}2\pi(\substitute{6.127})</mrow>

          </p>
        </sidebyside>
        <p>
          Therefore, Batula should order a column with a radius of <m>6.127</m> inches.
          A specific measurement like that may not be possible,
          but Batula could round to something like <m>6\,\frac{1}{8}</m> inches,
          which is very close.
          If the manufacturer wanted the diameter instead,
          we would multiply that by <m>2</m> to get <m>12.25</m> or <m>6\,\frac{1}{4}</m> inches.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Here is an example using volume.
    </p>

    <example>
      <!-- TODO: add picture -->
      <statement>
        <p>
          Mark is designing a cylindrical container for his ice cream business. He wants each container to be <m>15</m> centimeters tall and hold <m>1</m> gallon of ice cream. What dimension should Mark use for the radius of the container?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The formula for the volume of a cylinder is <m>V=\pi r^2h</m>,
          where <m>V</m> stands for the volume, <m>r</m> stands for the radius and <m>h</m> is the height.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since the volume is in gallons and the dimensions are in centimeters, we need to convert <m>1</m> gallon to cubic centimeters.
          <md>
              <mrow>1\,\text{gal}\amp=\frac{1\,\text{gal}}{1}\cdot\frac{231\,\text{in}^3}{1\,\text{gal}}\cdot\frac{2.54^3\,\text{cm}^3}{1\,\text{in}^3}</mrow>
              <!-- todo: these \cancel commands aren't rendering properly -->
              <mrow>\amp=\frac{1\,\cancel{\text{gal}}}{1}\cdot\frac{231\,\cancel{\text{in}^3}}{1\,\cancel{\text{gal}}}\cdot\frac{2.54^3\,\text{cm}^3}{1\,\cancel{\text{in}^3}}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp=1\cdot231\cdot2.54^3\,\text{cm}^3</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp=3785.41\,\text{cm}^3</mrow>
            </md>

          Now we can substitute the volume and height into the formula:
          <md>
            <mrow>V\amp=\pi r^2h</mrow>
            <mrow>3785.41\amp=\pi r^2(15)</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">
          <p>
            The next step is to divide both sides by <m>15\pi</m>.

              <mrow>3785.41\amp=15\pi r^2</mrow>

              <mrow>\sqrt{\frac{3785.41}{15\pi}}\amp=r</mrow>
              <mrow>8.963\amp\approx r</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Checking the solution <m>r\approx8.963</m> centimeters:
            <md>
              <mrow>3785.41\amp=\pi r^2h</mrow>

            </md>.
          </p>
        </sidebyside>
        <p>
          Note that our check is approximate because we rounded our answer.
          Mark will want to make the radius of his container at least <m>8.963</m> centimeters.
          He should make it a little larger to have space at the top of the container.

    <p>
      In the first triangle in <xref ref="figure-similar-triangles-intro">Figure</xref>,
      the ratio of the left side length to the hypotenuse length is <m>\frac{1\,\text{cm}}{2\,\text{cm}}</m>;
      in the second triangle,
      the ratio of the left side length to the hypotenuse length is <m>\frac{3\,\text{cm}}{6\,\text{cm}}</m>.
      Since both reduce to <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>,
      we can write the following proportion:

    <remark>
      <p>
        Looking at the triangles in <xref ref="figure-similar-triangles-intro">Figure</xref>,
        you may notice that there are many different proportions you could set up, such as:
        <md>
          <mrow>\frac{2\,\text{cm}}{1\,\text{cm}}\amp=\frac{6\,\text{cm}}{3\,\text{cm}}</mrow>
          <mrow>\frac{2\,\text{cm}}{6\,\text{cm}}\amp=\frac{1\,\text{cm}}{3\,\text{cm}}</mrow>

          <mrow>\frac{3\sqrt{3}\,\text{cm}}{\sqrt{3}\,\text{cm}}\amp=\frac{3\,\text{cm}}{1\,\text{cm}}</mrow>
        </md>
        This is often the case when we set up ratios and proportions.
      </p>

      <p>
        If we take a second look at <xref ref="figure-similar-triangles-with-unknown">Figure</xref>,
        there are also several other proportions we could have used to find the value of <m>x</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow>\frac{\text{bigger triangle's left side length}}{\text{smaller triangle's left side length}}\amp=\frac{\text{bigger triangle's bottom side length}}{\text{smaller triangle's bottom side length}}</mrow>
          <mrow />
          <mrow>\frac{\text{smaller triangle's bottom side length}}{\text{bigger triangle's bottom side length}}\amp=\frac{\text{smaller triangle's left side length}}{\text{bigger triangle's left side length}}</mrow>
          <mrow />
          <mrow>\frac{\text{bigger triangle's bottom side length}}{\text{smaller triangle's bottom side length}}\amp=\frac{\text{bigger triangle's left side length} }{\text{smaller triangle's left side length}}</mrow>
        </md>
        Written as algebraic proportions,
        these three equations would, respectively, be
        <md>
          <mrow>\frac{x\,\text{cm}}{3\,\text{cm}}\amp= \frac{6\,\text{cm}}{4\,\text{cm}}, \amp
          \frac{4\,\text{cm}}{6\,\text{cm}}\amp= \frac{3\,\text{cm}}{x\,\text{cm}}, \amp
          \frac{6\,\text{cm}}{4\,\text{cm}}\amp= \frac{x\,\text{cm}}{3\,\text{cm}}</mrow>
        </md>
        While these are only a few of the possibilities,
        if we clear the denominators from any properly designed proportion,
        every one is equivalent to <m>x=4.5</m>.
