      In this section, we will review how to graph lines and general functions which will be useful when we graph parabolas in the next section.
    </p>
    <p>
      An equation for a line usually comes in one of the following three forms:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <xref ref="section-slope-intercept-form" text="title"></xref>: <m>y=mx+b</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <xref ref="section-point-slope-form" text="title"></xref>: <m>y=m(x-x_0)+y_0</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <xref ref="section-standard-form" text="title"></xref>: <m>Ax+By=C</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      We will also consider both slope-intercept form and point-slope form as functions to build on our understanding of functions: <m>f(x)=mx+b</m> and <m>g(x)=m(x-x_0)+y_0</m>. Let's review how to graph lines in each form.

    <title>Graphing Lines by Plotting Points</title>
    <p>
      Sometimes, the easiest way to make a <xref ref="section-graphing-equations" text="title">graph of an equation</xref> is by doing so point-by-point. Let's refresh ourselves on how this works.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example-tub-drain-introduction">
      <p>
        Imagine that a bathtub is holding <m>12</m> gallons of water. The drain starts to leak water at a constant rate of <m>0.6</m> gallons per second. A linear function, <m>W(x)=-0.6x+12</m>, can be used to model the amount of water, in gallons, in the tub <m>x</m> seconds since it started draining. Let's make a graph of this function. The most straightforward method to graph any function is to build a table of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> values, and then plot the points:
      </p>

        <p>
          Was this the most informative table we could have made? Maybe not! The <m>y</m>-values are close together and mostly decimals which can be difficult to plot. Perhaps we should have chosen <m>x</m>-values that would have resulted in <xref ref="item-integer-definition">integer</xref> <m>y</m>-values. To do that, we would have needed to investigate the equation more carefully and have chosen <m>x</m>-values that were multiples of <m>5</m>. We will essentially do this in <xref ref="example-tub-drain-with-slope-intercept-form">Example</xref>.

      <p>
        The advantage of plotting points is that it is a universal method to graph any function. It’s easy to forget about this method after learning faster ways to graph functions, so to keep this method in your mathematical tool box in case you come across something that you don't remember how to graph.

    <title>Graphing Lines by in Slope-Intercept Form</title>
    <p>
      Recall that the <xref ref="section-slope-intercept-form" text="title">slope-intercept form</xref> of a line is <m>y=mx+b</m> where <m>m</m> is the slope and <m>(0,b)</m> is the vertical intercept.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example-tub-drain-with-slope-intercept-form">
      <p>
        A more efficient method to graph <m>W(x)=-0.6x+12</m> is to use the fact that it is in slope-intercept form. To quickly make a graph, examine the equation and pick out the slope (in this case <m>-0.6</m>) and vertical intercept (in this case <m>(0,12)</m>), and then plot slope-triangles from the intercept to locate more points on the line. One key point here is that it helps to have your <xref ref="definition-slope" text="title"></xref> written as a fraction. In this case, <me>-0.6=-\frac{6}{10}=-\frac{3}{5}</me>. So start our graph at <m>(0,12)</m> and go down <m>3</m> units and right <m>5</m> units to reach more points.
      </p>
      <sidebyside widths="37% 57%">
        <p>
           Since we know that we will go down <m>3</m> units and right <m>5</m> units, and that we will start our graph at <m>(0,12)</m>, we can choose to orient and scale our axes to see a full picture of <m>W</m> than we achieved by simply plotting convenient points.

    <title>Graphing Lines by in Point-Slope Form</title>
    <p>
      Recall that the <xref ref="section-point-slope-form" text="title">point-slope form</xref> of a line is <m>y=m(x-x_0)+y_0</m> where <m>m</m> is the slope and <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> is a point on the line.
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        The population of Monarch butterflies has been on a steady downward trajectory since the 1980s, as have many migratory animals. Blame has been cast all around and efforts to restore the population haven't had great success yet. There are several distinct populations of Monarchs that probably never meet each other: the Hawaii population, the Florida Keys population, the Western population, and the Eastern population. Of these, the Eastern population is by far the largest and we can model this population of Monarch butterflies by a simple linear equation: <me>M(x)=-(x-2006)+15</me> approximates the total number of acres of Mexican forest that the Eastern population of Monarchs hibernates in during winter in year <m>x</m>. This formula is only valid from 1995 to 2018, the years that the population has been studied.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's make graph of this equation given the information provided, but only between 1995 and 2018.

      <sidebyside widths="37% 57%">

           First, since this formula is given in point-slope form, the slope of the equation <m>M(x)=\mathbin{\highlight[magenta]{-}}(x-\highlight{2006})+\highlight{15}</m> is <m>\highlight[magenta]{-1}</m> and  the point given by the equation is <m>\highlight{(2006,15)}</m>. This means that we will need to scale our graph appropriately to be able to graph these details.

      <p>
        We can interpret the point <m>(2006,15)</m> to mean that in the year 2006, the Monarchs overwintered in <m>15</m> acres of Mexican forest. The slope means that for every one year that goes by, the overwintering population takes up about one acre less of forest.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point we should note that the slope-intercept form of this line could easily be found by <q>simplifying</q> the equation:
        <md>
          <mrow>M(x)\amp=-(x-2006)+14.5</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp=-x+2006+14.5</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp=\mathbin{\highlight[magenta]{-}}x+\highlight{2020.5}</mrow>
        </md>
        This version, <m>M(x)=-x+2020.5</m> has lost all meaning with regard to the butterfly population. This equation still tells us that the slope is <m>\highlight[magenta]{-1}</m>, and the vertical intercept is <m>\highlight{(0,2020.5)}</m>. Remember that <m>x</m> is the year, so the point <m>(0,2020.5)</m> means that in the year <m>0</m>, the Monarch population took up <m>2020.5</m> acres of land in Mexico. This is not only <m>100</m> times the size of the peak population in the 1980s, but the Aztecs of central Mexico were not conducting scientific surveys (that we know of) to count the butterflies in the year <m>0</m>. The moral of the story is that sometimes, point-slope is more telling for a certain situation and sometimes slope-intercept is more useful.
      </p>

    <exercise>

          From the equation, find the slope and a point on the graph of <m>m(x)=-\frac{9}{5}(x+1)-3</m>, and then use slope triangles to find the next two points on the line. Draw the line.
        </p>

        <p>
          The slope of <m>m(x)=\highlight{-\frac{9}{5}}(x+\highlight[magenta]{1})\mathbin{\highlight[magenta]{-}}\highlight[magenta]{3}</m> is <m>\highlight{-\frac{9}{5}}</m>. Also, since <m>(x+\highlight[magenta]{1})=(x-\highlight[magenta]{(-1)})</m>, the point on the graph given in the equation <m>m(x)=\highlight{-\frac{9}{5}}(x-\highlight[magenta]{(-1)})\mathbin{\highlight[magenta]{-}}\highlight[magenta]{3}</m> is <m>(\highlight[magenta]{-1},\highlight[magenta]{-3})</m>.

    <title>Graphing Lines Using Intercepts</title>
    <p>
      Recall that the <xref ref="section-standard-form" text="title">standard form</xref> of a line is <m>Ax+By=C</m> where where <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> are three numbers (each of which might be <m>0</m>, although at least one of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must be nonzero).
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
        Recall our bathtub draining problem from <xref ref="example-tub-drain-introduction">Example</xref>, where <m>W(x)=-0.6x+12</m> modeled the amount of water, in gallons, in the tub <m>x</m> seconds since it started draining. Let's change the formula <m>W(x)=-0.6x+12</m> into standard form.
      </p>
      <p>
        To find the <xref ref="subsection-transforming-between-standard-form-and-slope-intercept-form" text="title">standard form</xref> of the equation, first, we will replace the variable <m>W(x)</m> with <m>y</m> to make it look a little easier. So <m>W(x)=-0.6x+12</m> becomes <m>y=-0.6x+12</m>. Now, to convert to standard form, move both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> to the left-hand side and cancel the decimal by converting it to a fraction.
        <md>
          <mrow>y\amp=-0.6x+12</mrow>
          <mrow>0.6x+y\amp=12</mrow>
          <mrow>\frac{3}{5}x+y\amp=12</mrow>
          <mrow>\multiplyleft{5}\left(\frac{3}{5}x+y\right)\amp=12\multiplyright{5}</mrow>
          <mrow>3x+5y\amp=60</mrow>
        </md>
        The standard form for the equation is <m>3x+5y=60</m>
      </p>
    </example>

      <p>
        If a linear function is given in standard form, we can relative easily find the equations' <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>-intercepts by substituting in <m>y=0</m> and <m>x=0</m>, respectively.
      </p>

    <example>
      <p>
         Let's find the intercepts of <m>3x+5y=60</m>, still relating back to <xref ref="example-tub-drain-introduction">Example</xref>, and after that graph the equation given those intercepts.
      </p>
      <sidebyside>
        <p>
          To find the <m>x</m>-intercept, set <m>y=0</m> and solve for <m>x</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow>3x+5\substitute{(0)}\amp=60</mrow>
            <mrow>3x\amp=60</mrow>
            <mrow>x\amp=20</mrow>
          </md>
        So, the <m>x</m>-intercept is the point <m>(\highlight{20},\highlight[magenta]{0})</m>. In the context of the problem, this means that <m>\highlight{20}</m> minutes after the tub started to drain, <m>\highlight[magenta]{0}</m> gallons of water remained. This is telling us that the tub is empty!
        </p>
        <p>
          To find the <m>y</m>-intercept, set <m>x=0</m> and solve for <m>y</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow>3\substitute{(0)}+5y\amp=60</mrow>
            <mrow>5y\amp=60</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp=12</mrow>
          </md>
          So, the <m>y</m>-intercept is the point <m>(\highlight{0},\highlight[magenta]{12})</m>. In the context of the problem, this means that <m>\highlight{0}</m> minutes after the tub started to drain, <m>\highlight[magenta]{12}</m> gallons of water remained. This is telling us how much water was initially in the tub.

    <title>Graphing Functions by Plotting Points</title>
    <p>
      Any function, linear or not, can be graphed by building a table of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> values and plotting points. Let’s look at a few more examples.
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        Imagine a company called Corduroy's-Я-Us that makes pants. Their profit from their Royal Blue Corduroys, in thousands of dollars, can be modeled by the function <m>P(x)=-0.5x^2+33x-200</m> where <m>x</m> is the price of each pair of Royal Blue pants that they sell. Let's build a table of values and plot the function’s graph.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this context, the value of <m>x</m> must be positive. We'll start at <m>0</m> and look at the first few y-values:

        <p>
          The wind chill is how cold it <em>feels</em> outside due to the wind. Imagine a chilly <mag>32</mag><unit base="fahrenheit" /> day with a breeze blowing over the snowy ground. The wind chill, <m>w(v)</m> at this temperature can be approximated by the formula <m>w(v)=55-21\sqrt[6]{v}</m> where <m>v</m> is the speed of the wind in miles per hour. Create a table of values for the wind chill at realistic wind speeds and make a graph of <m>w</m>.

Example 2: A factory produces spherical containers. The function r(V)=∛(3V/4π) can calculate the container’s radius, in inches, given its volume, in cubic inches. Graph the function by plotting points.
Solution: We will only plot the function in the first quadrant because r>0 in this context.

x-value y-value Point Interpretation
0 r(0)=∛((3(0))/4π)=0 (0,0)
If the volume is 0 cubic inch, its radius is 0 inch.
10  r(10)=∛((3(10))/4π)=1.34  (10,1.34) If the volume is 10 cubic inches, its radius is 1.34 inches.
20  r(20)=∛((3(20))/4π)=1.68  (20,1.68)
If the volume is 20 cubic inches, its radius is 1.68 inches.
30  r(30)=∛((3(30))/4π)=1.93  (30,1.93)
If the volume is 30 cubic inches, its radius is 1.93 inches.
40  r(40)=∛((3(40))/4π)=2.12  (40,2.12)
If the volume is 40 cubic inches, its radius is 2.12 inches.


The more points we plot, the more accurate the graph would be.

Checkpoint: Sketch the graph of f(x)=2√(x-3)+1 by plotting points.

Exercises:

Borrow some problems from Section 4.9: Summary of Graphing Lines

Use a table to make a plot for a few random quadratic functions.
One or two cubic functions.
One or two radical functions, including square root and cube root.
One or two absolute value functions.
One or two rational functions (?) -->
