        <p>The word <q>fraction</q> comes from the Latin word <foreign>fractio</foreign>, which means <q>break into pieces.</q> For thousands of years, cultures from all over the world have used fractions to understand parts of a whole.</p>

            <p>One approach to understanding fractions is to think of them as parts of a whole.</p>

The <term>denominator</term> <m>7</m> tells us how many parts to cut up the whole; since we have <m>7</m> parts, they're called <q>sevenths.</q> The <term>numerator</term> <m>3</m> tells us how many sevenths to consider. <idx><h>fraction</h><h>numerator</h></idx><idx><h>fraction</h><h>denominator</h></idx><idx><h>numerator</h></idx><idx><h>denominator</h></idx></p>

        <p>Those two fractions, <m>\frac{2}{5}</m> and <m>\frac{6}{15}</m> are equal, as those figures demonstrate. Also, because they each equal <m>0.4</m> as a decimal. If we must work with this number, the fraction that uses smaller numbers, <m>\frac{2}{5}</m>, is preferable. Working with smaller numbers decreases the likelihood of making a human arithmetic error. And it also increases the chances that you might make useful observations about the nature of that number.</p>

        <sidebyside widths="65% 29%" margins="0%">
            <p>So if you are handed a fraction like <m>\frac{6}{15}</m>, it is important to try to <term>reduce</term> it to <q>lowest terms.</q><idx><h>reduced fraction</h></idx><idx><h>fraction</h><h>reduction</h></idx> The most important skill you can have to help you do this is to know the multiplication table well. If you know it well, you know that <m>6=2\cdot3</m> and <m>15=3\cdot5</m>, so you can break down the numerator and denominator that way. Both the numerator and denominator are divisible by <m>3</m>, so they can be <q>factored out</q> and then as factors, cancel out.</p>

            <title>Multiplying a Fraction and a Whole Number</title>
            <p>When you multiply a whole number by a fraction, you may just multiply the whole number by the numerator and leave the denominator alone. In other words, as long as <m>d</m> is not <m>0</m>, then a whole number and a fraction multiply this way:<me>a \cdot \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a\cdot c}{d}</me></p>
        </fact>

        <example>
            <p>We could also use multiplication to decrease amounts. Suppose we needed to cut the recipe down to just one fifth. Instead of <em>four</em> of the <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> cup milk, we need <em>one fifth</em> of the <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> cup milk. So instead of multiplying by <m>4</m>, we multiply by <m>\frac{1}{5}</m>. But how much is <m>\frac{1}{5}</m> of <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> cup?</p>

                <p>If we cut the measuring cup into five equal vertical strips along with the three equal horizontal strips, then in total there are <m>3\cdot5=15</m> subdivisions of the cup. Two of those sections represent <m>\frac{1}{5}</m> of the <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> cup.</p>

        <p>How does division with fractions work? Are we able to compute/simplify each of these examples?<ol label="a." cols="4">

            </li>
        </ol></p>

        <p>We know that when we divide something by <m>2</m>, this is the same as multiplying it by <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>. Conversely, dividing a number or expression by <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> is the same as multiplying by <m>\frac{2}{1}</m>, or just <m>2</m>. The more general property is that when we divide a number or expression by <m>\frac{a}{b}</m>, this is equivalent to multiplying by the reciprocal <m>\frac{b}{a}</m>.</p>

        <title>Adding and Subtracting Fractions</title>

        <p>With whole numbers and integers, operations of addition and subtraction are relatively straightforward. The situation is almost as straightforward with fractions <em>if the two fractions have the same denominator</em>. Consider
            <me>\frac{7}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 7\text{ halves}+3\text{ halves}</me>
        In the same way that <m>7</m> tacos and <m>3</m> tacos make <m>10</m> tacos, we have:
        <me>
            \begin{array}{ccccc}
                7\text{ halves}{}\amp+{}\amp 3\text{ halves}\amp=\amp 10\text{ halves} \\
                \frac{7}{2}{}\amp+{}\amp\frac{3}{2}\amp=\amp\frac{10}{2} \\
                \amp \amp \amp=\amp5 \\
            \end{array}
        </me>
        </p>

        <p>Whenever we'd like to combine fractional amounts that don't represent the same number of parts of a whole (that is, when the denominators are different), finding sums and differences is more complicated.</p>

        <example>
            <title>Quarters and Dimes</title>
            <p>Find the sum <m>\frac{3}{4}+\frac{2}{10}</m>. Does this seem intimidating? Consider this:<ul>
                <li>
                    <p><m>\frac{1}{4}</m> of a dollar is a quarter, and so <m>\frac{3}{4}</m> of a dollar is <m>75</m> cents.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><m>\frac{1}{10}</m> of a dollar is a dime, and so <m>\frac{2}{10}</m> of a dollar is <m>20</m> cents.</p>
                </li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>So if you know what to look for, the expression <m>\frac{3}{4}+\frac{2}{10}</m> is like adding <m>75</m> cents and <m>20</m> cents, which gives you <m>95</m> cents. As a fraction of one dollar, that is <m>\frac{95}{100}</m>. So we can report <me>\frac{3}{4}+\frac{2}{10}=\frac{95}{100}</me>. (Although we should probably reduce that last fraction to <m>\frac{19}{20}</m>.)</p>
        </example>

        <p>This example was not something you can apply to other fraction addition situations, because the denominators here worked especially well with money amounts. But there is something we can learn here. The fraction <m>\frac{3}{4}</m> was equivalent to <m>\frac{75}{100}</m>, and the other fraction <m>\frac{2}{10}</m> was equivalent to <m>\frac{20}{100}</m>. These <em>equivalent</em> fractions have the same denominator and are therefore <q>easy</q> to add. What we saw happen was:<md>
            <mrow>\frac{3}{4}+\frac{2}{10}\amp=\frac{75}{100}+\frac{20}{100}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=\frac{95}{100}</mrow>
        </md></p>

        <p>This realization gives us a strategy for adding (or subtracting) fractions.</p>

        <title>Mixed Numbers and Improper Fractions</title>
        <p>A simple recipe for bread contains only a few ingredients:</p>

                <row>
                    <cell><m>1\,\sfrac{1}{2}</m></cell>
                    <cell>tablespoons yeast</cell>

                    <cell>tablespoons kosher salt</cell>
                </row>
                <row>
                    <cell><m>6\,\sfrac{1}{2}</m></cell>
                    <cell>cups unbleached, all-purpose flour (more for dusting)</cell>
                </row>
            </tabular>
        </sidebyside>

        <p>Each ingredient is listed as a <term>mixed number</term><idx><h>fraction</h><h>mixed number</h></idx><idx><h>mixed number</h></idx> that quickly communicates how many whole amounts and how many parts are needed. It's useful for quickly communicating a practical amount of something you are cooking with, measuring on a ruler, purchasing at the grocery store, etc. But it causes trouble in an algebra class. The number <m>1\,\sfrac{1}{2}</m> means <q>one <alert>and</alert> one half.</q> So really,
        <me>1\,\frac{1}{2}=1+\frac{1}{2}</me>
        The trouble is that with <m>1\,\sfrac{1}{2}</m>, you have two numbers written right next to each other. Normally with two math expressions written right next to each other, they should be <em>multiplied</em>, not <em>added</em>. But with a mixed number, they <em>should</em> be added.</p>

                <p>Fortunately we just reviewed how to add fractions. If we need to do any arithmetic with a mixed number like <m>1\,\sfrac{1}{2}</m>, we can treat it as <m>1+\frac{1}{2}</m> and simplify to get a <q>nice</q> fraction instead: <m>\frac{3}{2}</m>. A fraction like <m>\frac{3}{2}</m> is called an <term>improper fraction</term><idx><h>fraction</h><h>improper</h></idx><idx><h>improper fraction</h></idx> because it's actually larger than <m>1</m>. And a <q>proper</q> fraction would be something small that is only <em>part</em> of a whole instead of <em>more</em> than a whole.</p>

                        <p>Since the fractions don't have the same denominator, we have to make them have like denominators. Multiply the first fraction by <m>\frac{5}{5}</m>.
