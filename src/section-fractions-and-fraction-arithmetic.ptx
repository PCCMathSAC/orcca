<!--
            <p>Many people find fractions frustrating to calculate with. Having an open-minded attitude is possibly the most important thing you can do to combat this. Fractions are for sharing, and sharing is good. So it's important that we work on learning to appreciate fractions. Appreciation is difficult without understanding, so let's work on understanding fractions better.</p>
-->
            <p>The word <q>fraction</q> comes from the Latin word <foreign>fractio</foreign>, which means <q>break into pieces.</q> Ancient cultures all over the world use fractions to understand parts of wholes, but it took humanity thousands of years to develop the symbols we use today.</p>

            <title>Parts of a Whole</title>

            <p>One approach to understanding fractions is to think of them as counting parts of a whole.</p>

            <p>In <xref ref="figure-fraction">Figure</xref>, we see <m>1</m> whole amount divided into <m>7</m> parts. Since <m>3</m> of the <m>7</m> parts are highlighted, we have an illustration of the fraction <m>\frac{3}{7}</m>. The <term>denominator</term> <m>7</m> lets us know how many equal parts of the whole amount we're considering; since we've got <m>7</m> parts here, they're called <q>sevenths.</q> The <term>numerator</term> <m>3</m> tells us how many of those sevenths we're considering.</p>

            <exercise>
                <title>A Fraction as Parts of a Whole</title>
                <webwork>
                    <statement>
                        <p>To visualize the fraction <m>\frac{14}{35}</m>, you might cut a rectangle into <var name="35" width="2" /> equal parts, and then count up <var name="14" width="2" /> of them.</p>
                    </statement>
                </webwork>
            </exercise>

            <p>Instead of using rectangles, we can also locate fractions on number lines. When a number line is marked off with whole numbers, equal divisions of the unit <m>1</m> can represent the equal parts, as in <xref ref="figure-fraction-number-line">Figure</xref>.</p>

        <p>Those two fractions, <m>\frac{2}{5}</m> and <m>\frac{6}{15}</m> are equal, as those figures demonstrate. Also, because they each equal <m>0.4</m> as a decimal. If we must work with this number, the fraction that uses smaller numbers, <m>\frac{2}{5}</m>, is preferable. Working with smaller numbers decreases the likelihood of making a human arithmetic error. And it also increases the chances that you might make useful observations about the nature of that number.</p>

        <title>Division with Fractions</title>

        <!-- First stab at this has this scenario of measuring cups below. I find it confusing to read and possibly uninteresting to a typical student. Replacing with something less ambitious. -->

        <!--<p>Multiplication works when we ask about <q>How much is this fraction of that amount?</q> Division answers the question <q>How many of those amounts fit into that amount?</q></p>

        <p>Suppose a baker lost their <m>\frac{1}{3}</m> cup measuring cup, and wanted to use a <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> cup measuring cup to measure out <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> cup of brown sugar. They'd need to answer <q>How many <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> cups are in <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> cup?</q> That is, they'd need to find <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> divided by <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>. Let's start by sketching amounts:</p>

        <todo>(sketch of ⅔, sketch of 1/2)</todo>
                <figure>
                    <image source = "images/fractions-rectangles-two-thirds-and-one-half.jpg" width = "50%">
                        <description></description>
                    </image>
                </figure> 

        <p>Remember that love for fractions depends on understanding which whole amount has our attention. When we ask <q>How many <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> cups are in <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> cup?</q> we are asking about a number of <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> cups. That means that the <em>whole</em> amount in this division problem is a <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> cup. Okay, let's look back at the situation with both thirds and halves in the same picture:</p>

        <todo>(sketch of ⅔ with 1/2 as well)</todo>
                <figure>
                    <image source = "images/fractions-rectangle-two-thirds-and-one-half.jpg" width = "50%">
                        <description></description>
                    </image>
                </figure> 

        <p>Can you see how many halves are in <m>\frac{2}{3}</m>?</p>

        <todo>(sketch of ⅔ with 1/2 labeled as “whole”)</todo>
                <figure>
                    <image source = "images/fractions-rectangle-two-thirds-with-one-half-as-whole.jpg" width = "50%">
                        <description></description>
                    </image>
                </figure> 

        <p>There <m>\frac{4}{3}</m> halves in <m>\frac{2}{3}</m>. That means that <m>\frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{2} = \frac{4}{3}</m>.</p>

        <p>If we look back at the sketch, and ask <q>How much is <m>\frac{2}{1}</m> of <m>\frac{2}{3}</m>?</q> Looking carefully, we <q>see</q> that <m>\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{1} = \frac{4}{3}</m>. We've sketched both division and multiplication in one sketch. If we love fractions enough, we can <q>see</q> that <m>\frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{1} = \frac{4}{3}</m>.</p>

        <p>This works no matter what amounts we use as well: <m>\frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{d}{c} = \frac{ad}{bc}</m></p>-->

        <p>How does division with fractions work? Are we able to compute/simplify each of these examples?<me>3\div\frac{2}{7}\qquad\frac{18}{19}\div5\qquad\frac{14}{3}\div\frac{8}{9}\qquad\frac{\ \frac{2}{5}\ }{\frac{5}{2}}</me></p>
<!-- The purpose of this paragraph is to explain why fraction division is difficult? I don't think it helps understanding.
        <p>Just as with whole number division, each of these expressions can be interpreted as asking <q>how many times does the denominator go into the numerator?</q> When the result itself is some fraction, this can be hard to process mentally. With <m>3\div\frac{2}{7}</m>, perhaps you can see that ten multiples of <m>\frac{2}{7}</m> will <em>almost</em> get you to <m>3</m>, because <m>10\cdot\frac{2}{7}=\frac{20}{7}</m> is just a little shy of <m>\frac{21}{7}=3</m>. But what do you make of the leftover <m>\frac{1}{7}</m>? It's challenging to interpret that correctly to get the correct final result.</p>
-->
 <!--       <p>The purely mechanical way to divide by a fraction is to recognize that:<ul>
            <li>
                <p>Multiplying a number by <m>\frac{a}{b}</m> and then immediately dividing the result by the same number <m>\frac{a}{b}</m> leaves the orignal number unchanged.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Multiplying a number by <m>\frac{a}{b}</m> and then immediately <em>multiplying</em> the result by <m>\frac{b}{a}</m> also leaves the orignal number unchanged. (Note that the numerators and denominators have switched places.) This must be true because in symbols, <m>{}\cdot\frac{a}{b}\cdot\frac{b}{a}={}\cdot\frac{ab}{ab}={}\cdot1</m>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>
-->
        <p>We know that when we divide something by <m>2</m>, this is the same as multiplying it by <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>. Conversely, dividing a number or expression by <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> is the same as multiplying by <m>\frac{2}{1}</m>, or just <m>2</m>. The more general property is that when we divide a number or expression by <m>\frac{a}{b}</m>, this is equivalent to multiplying by the reciprocal <m>\frac{b}{a}</m>.</p>

        <p>Whenever we'd like to combine fractional amounts that don't represent the same number of parts of a whole (that is, when the denominators are different), finding sums and differences is more complicated.</p>

        <example>
            <title>Quarters and Dimes</title>
            <p>Find the sum <m>\frac{3}{4}+\frac{2}{10}</m>. Does this seem intimidating? Consider this:<ul>
                <li>
                    <p><m>\frac{1}{4}</m> of a dollar is a quarter, and so <m>\frac{3}{4}</m> of a dollar is <m>75</m> cents.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><m>\frac{1}{10}</m> of a dollar is a dime, and so <m>\frac{2}{10}</m> of a dollar is <m>20</m> cents.</p>
                </li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>So if you know what to look for, the expression <m>\frac{3}{4}+\frac{2}{10}</m> is like adding <m>75</m> cents and <m>20</m> cents, which gives you <m>95</m> cents. As a fraction of one dollar, that is <m>\frac{95}{100}</m>. So we can report <me>\frac{3}{4}+\frac{2}{10}=\frac{95}{100}</me>. (Although we should probably reduce that last fraction to <m>\frac{19}{20}</m>.)</p>
        </example>

        <p>This example was not something you can apply to other fraction addition situations, because the denominators here worked especially well with money amounts. But there is something we can learn here. The fraction <m>\frac{3}{4}</m> was equivalent to <m>\frac{75}{100}</m>, and the other fraction <m>\frac{2}{10}</m> was equivalent to <m>\frac{20}{100}</m>. These <em>equivalent</em> fractions have the same denominator and are therefore <q>easy</q> to add. What we saw happen was:<md>
            <mrow>\frac{3}{4}+\frac{2}{10}\amp=\frac{75}{100}+\frac{20}{100}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=\frac{95}{100}</mrow>
        </md></p>

        <p>This realization gives us a strategy for adding (or subtracting) fractions.</p>

        <fact>
            <title>Adding/Subtracting Fractions with Different Denominators</title>
            <statement>
                <p>To add (or subtract) generic fractions together, use their denominators to find a <term>common denominator</term>. This means some whole number that is a whole multiple of both of the original denominators. Then rewrite the two fractions as <em>equivalent</em> fractions that use this common denominator. Write the result <em>keeping</em> that denominator and adding (or subtracting) the numerators. Reduce the fraction if that is useful or required.</p> 
            </statement>

        <!--
        <p>Luckily, we've already done some of the work. Let's add the fractions <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> and <m>\frac{2}{5}</m> together.</p>

        <p>To graph both <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> and <m>\frac{2}{5}</m> on the same number line, we needed to see the values as equivalent fractions <m>\frac{10}{15}</m> and <m>\frac{6}{15}</m>. Adding those amounts works just like addition on the number line.</p>

        <todo>(number line picture of 10/15 + 6/15 = 16/15)</todo>
                <figure>
                    <image source = "images/fractions-number-line-ten-fifteenths-plus-six-fifteenths.jpg" width = "50%">
                        <description></description>
                    </image>
                </figure> 

        <p>So <m>\frac{10}{15} + \frac{6}{15} = \frac{10+6}{15} = \frac{16}{15}</m>. Finding the sum of the numerators makes sense because we're adding equal-sized parts of the whole (fifteenths) together. Those equal-sized parts of the whole are called the <term>common denominator</term>.</p>

        <p>To see this idea another way, let's look again at our sketches of both values, breaking the whole two ways:</p>

        <todo>(rectangular sketches of ⅔ and ⅖)</todo>
                <figure>
                    <image source = "images/fractions-rectangles-two-thirds-and-two-fifths.jpg" width = "50%">
                        <description></description>
                    </image>
                </figure> 

        <p>Now if we divide both sketches further so we can see fifteenths of both wholes, we can see the sum:</p>

        <todo>(rectangular sketches of 10/15 and 6/15)</todo>
                <figure>
                    <image source = "images/fractions-rectangles-ten-fifteenths-and-six-fifteenths.jpg" width = "50%">

                    </image>
                </figure>
        -->

        <example>
            <p>Let's add <m>\frac{2}{3}+\frac{2}{5}</m>. The denominators are <m>3</m> and <m>5</m>, so the number <m>15</m> would be a good common denominator.<md>

        <p>A simple recipe for bread contains only a few ingredients:</p>

            <caption>Ingredients for simple crusty bread.</caption>
            <tabular>
                <row>

        <p>Each ingredient is listed as a <term>mixed number</term> that quickly communicates how many whole amounts and how many parts are needed. It's useful for quickly communicating a practical amount of something you are cooking with, measuring on a ruler, purchasing at the grocery store, etc. But it causes trouble in an algebra class. The number <m>1\,\sfrac{1}{2}</m> means <q>one <alert>and</alert> one half.</q> So really, 
        <me>1\,\frac{1}{2}=1+\frac{1}{2}</me>
        The trouble is that with <m>1\,\sfrac{1}{2}</m>, you have two numbers written right next to each other. Normally with two math expressions written right next to each other, they should be <em>multiplied</em>, not <em>added</em>. But with a mixed number, they <em>should</em> be added.</p>

        <p>Fortunately we just reviewed how to add fractions. If we need to do any arithmetic with a mixed number like <m>1\,\sfrac{1}{2}</m>, we can treat it as <m>1+\frac{1}{2}</m> and simplify to get a <q>nice</q> fraction instead:<md>
            <mrow>1\,\frac{1}{2}\amp=1+\frac{1}{2}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{2}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=\frac{2}{2}+\frac{1}{2}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=\frac{3}{2}</mrow>
        </md> A fraction like <m>\frac{3}{2}</m> is called an <term>improper fraction</term> because it's actually larger than <m>1</m>. And a <q>proper</q> fraction would be something small that is only <em>part</em> of a whole instead of <em>more</em> than a whole.</p>
