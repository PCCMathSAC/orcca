        <title>Solving Multistep Inequalities</title>
        <p>When solving a linear inequality, we follow the same steps in <xref ref="list-solve-multistep-linear-equation">List</xref>. The only difference in our steps to solving is that when we multiply or divide by a negative number on both sides of an inequality, the direction of the inequality symbol must switch. We will look at some examples.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Note that when we divided both sides of the inequality by <m>-3</m>, we had to switch the direction of the inequality symbol.</p>
                <p>The solution set in set-builder notation is <m>\{t\mid t\leq-2\}</m>.</p>
                <p>The solution set in interval notation is <m>(-\infty,-2]</m>.</p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <remark>
            <p>Since the inequality solved in <xref ref="example-inequality-simple">Example</xref> has infinitely many solutions, it's difficult to check. We found that all values of <m>t</m> for which <m>t\leq-2</m> are solutions, so one approach is to check if <m>-2</m> is a solution and additionally if one other number less than <m>-2</m> is a solution.</p>

            <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">
                <p>Here, we'll check that <m>-2</m> satisfies this inequality:
                <md>
                    <mrow>-3t+5\amp\geq11</mrow>
                    <mrow>-3(\substitute{-2})+5\amp\stackrel{?}{\geq}11</mrow>
                    <mrow>6+5\amp\stackrel{?}{\geq}11</mrow>
                    <mrow>11\amp\stackrel{\checkmark}{\geq}11</mrow>
                </md></p>
                <p>Next, we can check another number smaller than <m>-2</m>, such as <m>-5</m>:
                <md>
                    <mrow>-3t+5\amp\geq11</mrow>
                    <mrow>-3(\substitute{-5})+5\amp\stackrel{?}{\geq}11</mrow>
                    <mrow>15+5\amp\stackrel{?}{\geq}11</mrow>
                    <mrow>20\amp\stackrel{\checkmark}{\geq}11</mrow>
                </md></p>
            </sidebyside>
            <p>Thus both <m>-2</m> and <m>-5</m> are solutions. It's important to note that this doesn't directly verify that <em>all</em> solutions to this inequality check. It's valuable though in that it would likely help us catch an error if we had made one. Consult your instructor to see if you're expected to check your answer in this manner.</p>

            </solution>
        </example>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>When a stopwatch started, the pressure inside a gas container was <m>4.2</m> atm (standard atmospheric pressure). As the container was heated, the pressure increased by <m>0.7</m> atm per minute. The maximum pressure the container can handle was <m>21.7</m> atm. Heating must be stopped once the pressure reaches <m>21.7</m> atm. In what time interval was the container safe?</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>The pressure increases by <m>0.7</m> atm per minute, so it increases by <m>0.7m</m> after <m>m</m> minutes. Counting in the original pressure of <m>4.2</m> atm, pressure in the container can be modeled by <m>0.7m+4.2</m>, where <m>m</m> is the number of minutes since the stop watch started.</p>

                <p>The container is safe when the pressure is <m>21.7</m> atm or lower. We can write and solve this inequality:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>0.7m+4.2\amp\leq21.7</mrow>
                        <mrow>0.7m+4.2\subtractright{4.2}\amp\leq21.7\subtractright{4.2}</mrow>
                        <mrow>0.7m\amp\leq17.5</mrow>
                        <mrow>\divideunder{0.7m}{0.7}\amp\leq\divideunder{17.5}{0.7}</mrow>
                        <mrow>m\amp\leq25</mrow>
                    </md>
                </p>

                <p>In summary, the container was safe as long as <m>m\leq25</m>. Assuming that <m>m</m> also must be greater than or equal to zero, this means <m>0\leq m\leq 25</m>. We can write this as the time interval as <m>[0,25]</m>. Thus the container was safe between 0 minutes and 25 minutes.</p>
