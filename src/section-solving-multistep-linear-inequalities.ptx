          This is evidence that our solution set is correct,

          The maximum pressure the container can handle was <m>21.7</m> atm.
          Heating must be stopped once the pressure reaches <m>21.7</m> atm.
          Over what time interval was the container in a safe state?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution permid="fwL">
        <p permid="Piu">
          The pressure increases by <m>0.7</m> atm per minute,
          so it increases by <m>0.7m</m> after <m>m</m> minutes.
          Counting in the original pressure of <m>4.2</m> atm,
          pressure in the container can be modeled by <m>0.7m+4.2</m>,
          where <m>m</m> is the number of minutes since the stop watch started.
        </p>

        <p permid="vpD">
          The container is safe when the pressure is <m>21.7</m> atm or lower.
          We can write and solve this inequality:
          <md permid="BOJ">
            <mrow>0.7m+4.2\amp\leq21.7</mrow>
            <mrow>0.7m+4.2\subtractright{4.2}\amp\leq21.7\subtractright{4.2}</mrow>
            <mrow>0.7m\amp\leq17.5</mrow>
            <mrow>\divideunder{0.7m}{0.7}\amp\leq\divideunder{17.5}{0.7}</mrow>
            <mrow>m\amp\leq25</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p permid="bwM">
          In summary, the container was safe as long as <m>m\leq25</m>.
          Assuming that <m>m</m> also must be greater than or equal to zero,
          this means <m>0\leq m\leq 25</m>. We can write this as the time interval as <m>[0,25]</m>.
          Thus the container was safe between 0 minutes and 25 minutes.
        </p>
