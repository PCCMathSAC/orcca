      When solving a linear inequality,
      we follow the same steps in <xref ref="list-solve-multistep-linear-equation">List</xref>.
      The only difference in our steps to solving is that when we multiply or divide by a negative number on both sides of an inequality,
      the direction of the inequality symbol must switch.
      We will look at some examples.

          When a stopwatch started,

          (standard atmospheric pressure).
          As the container was heated,

          The pressure increases by <m>0.7</m> atm per minute,

          Counting in the original pressure of <m>4.2</m> atm,
          pressure in the container can be modeled by <m>0.7m+4.2</m>,
          where <m>m</m> is the number of minutes since the stop watch started.

        <p permid="vpD">
          The container is safe when the pressure is <m>21.7</m> atm or lower.

        <p permid="bwM">
          In summary, the container was safe as long as <m>m\leq25</m>.
          Assuming that <m>m</m> also must be greater than or equal to zero,
          this means <m>0\leq m\leq 25</m>.
          We can write this as the time interval as <m>[0,25]</m>.
          Thus the container was safe between 0 minutes and 25 minutes.
