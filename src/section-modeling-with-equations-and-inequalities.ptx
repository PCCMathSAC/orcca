  <introduction>
    <p>
      One purpose of learning math is to be able to model real-life situations
      and then use the model to ask and answer questions about the situation.
      In this lesson,
      we will examine the basics of modeling to set up an equation
      (or inequality).

  <subsection>
    <title>Setting Up Equations for Rate Models</title>
    <p>
      To set up an equation modeling a real world scenario,
      the first thing we need to do is identify what variable we will use.
      The variable we use will be determined by whatever is unknown in our problem statement.
      Once we've identified and defined our variable,
      we'll use the numerical information provided to set up our equation.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-savings-pattern">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A savings account starts with <m>\$500</m>.
          Each month, an automatic deposit of <m>\$150</m> is made.
          Write an equation that represents the number of months it will take for the balance to reach <m>\$1{,}700</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">

          <stack>
            <p>
              To set up an equation, we might start by making a table
              in order to identify a general pattern for the total amount in the account after <m>m</m> months.
              In <xref ref="figure-savings-pattern">Figure</xref>,
              we find the pattern is that after <m>m</m> months,
              the total amount saved is <m>500+150m</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Using this pattern,
              we determine that an equation representing when the total savings equals <m>\$1700</m> is: <me> 500+150m=1700 </me>
            </p>

          Right now we are not interested in actually solving this equation
          and finding the number of months <m>m</m> until the savings has reached <m>\$1700</m>.
          The skill of <em>setting up</em> that equation is challenging enough,
          and this section only focuses on that setup.

    <!-- <example>
      <p>
        To determine the solution to the equation in <xref ref="example-savings-pattern">Example</xref>,
        we could continue the pattern in <xref ref="figure-savings-pattern">Figure</xref>:
      </p>

      <sidebyside margins="0%" widths="47% 47%">
        <p>
          We can see that the value of <m>m</m> that makes the equation true is <m>8</m> as <m>500+150(8)=1700</m>.
          Thus it would take <m>8</m> months for an account starting with <m>\$500</m> to reach
          <m>\$1{,}700</m> if <m>\$150</m> is saved each month.

      <p>
        Here we are able to determine the solution by creating a table and using inputs that were whole numbers.
        Often the solution will not be something we can find this way.
        We will need to solve the equation using algebra,
        as we'll learn how to do in later sections.
        For this section, we'll only focus on setting up the equation.

            Since this problem refers to <em>when</em> the amount of water will reach a certain amount,
            we immediately know that the unknown quantity is time.
            As the volume of water in the tub is measured in <quantity><unit base="foot" exp="3"/></quantity> per minute,
            we know that time needs to be measured in minutes.
            We'll define <m>t</m> to be the number of minutes that water is poured into the tub.
            To determine this equation, we'll start by making a table of values:

    <title>Setting Up Equations for Percent Problems</title>
    <p>
      <xref ref="section-percentages">Section</xref> reviews some basics of working with percentages,
      and even solves some one-step equations that are set up using percentages.
      Here we look at some scenarios where there is an equation to set up based on percentages,
      but it things are a little more complicated than with a one-step equation. One important fact is that when doing math with percentages, we always start by rewriting the percentage as a decimal. For example, <m>18\%</m> should be written as <m>0.18</m> if you are going to us it to do algebra or arithmetic.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-salary-increase">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Jakobi's annual salary as a nurse in Portland, Oregon, is <m>\$73{,}290</m>.
          His salary increased by <m>4\%</m> from last year.
          Write a linear equation modeling this scenario,
          where the unknown value is Jakobi's salary last year.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We want to work with Jakobi's salary last year.
          So we'll introduce <m>s</m>, defined to be Jakobi's salary last year (in dollars).
          To set up the equation, we need to think about how he arrived at this year's salary.
          To get to this year's salary, his employer took last year's salary and added <m>4\%</m> to it.
          Conceptually, this means we have:
          <me> (\text{last year's salary})+(4\%\text{ of last year's salary}) = (\text{this year's salary}) </me>
          We'll represent <m>4\%</m> of last year's salary with <m>0.04s</m> since <m>0.04</m> is the decimal representation of <m>4\%</m>.
          This means that the equation we set up is: <me>s+0.04s=73290 </me>

              We'd like to know what was the bill before tip. Set up an equation for this situation.

              A common mistake is to translate a question like this into
              <q>what is <m>19\%</m> of <m>\$150</m>?</q>
              as a way to calculate the tip amount,
              and then subtract that from <m>\$150</m>.
              But that is not how tipping works.
              The <m>19\%</m>is applied to the <em>original bill</em>, not the <em>final total</em>.
              If we let <m>x</m> represent the original bill, then:

        <p>
          The price of a refrigerator after a <m>15\%</m> discount is <m>\$612</m>.
          Write a linear equation modeling this scenario,
          where the original price of the refrigerator
          (before the discount was applied)
          is the unknown quantity.

      <solution>
        <p>
          We'll let <m>c</m> be the original price of the refrigerator.
          To obtain the discounted price,
          we take the original price and subtract <m>15\%</m> of that amount.
          Conceptually, this looks like:

            (\text{original price})-(15\%\text{ of the original price})= (\text{discounted price})

    <title>Setting Up Inequalities for Models</title>
    <p>
      In general, we'll model using inequalities when we want to determine a maximum or minimum value.
      To identify that an inequality is needed instead of an equality,
      we'll look for phrases like <em>at least,
      at most, at a minimum</em> or <em>at a maximum</em>.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The car share company car2go has a one-time registration fee of <m>\$5</m> and charges <m>\$14.99</m> per hour for use of their vehicles.
          Hana wants to use car2go and has a maximum budget of <m>\$300</m>.
          Write a linear inequality representing this scenario,
          where the unknown quantity is the number of hours she uses their vehicles.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We'll let <m>h</m> be the number of hours that Hana uses car2go.
          We need the initial cost and the cost from the hourly charge to be less than or equal to <m>\$300</m>,
          which we set up as:
          <me>
            5+14.99h \le 300
          </me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          When an oil tank is decommissioned,
          it is drained of its remaining oil and then re-filled with an inert material,
          such as sand.
          A cylindrical oil tank has a volume of
          <quantity>
            <mag>275</mag><unit base="gallon"/>
          </quantity>
          and is being filled with sand at a rate of
          <quantity>
            <mag>700</mag><unit base="gallon"/>
          </quantity>
          per hour.
          Write a linear inequality representing this scenario,
          where the time it takes for the tank to overflow with sand is the unknown quantity.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The unknown in this scenario is time,
          so we'll define <m>t</m> to be the number of hours that sand is poured into the tank.
          (Note that we chose hours based on the rate at which the sand is being poured.)
          We'll represent the amount of sand poured in as <m>700t</m> as each hour an additional
          <quantity>
            <mag>700</mag><unit base="gallon"/>
          </quantity>
          are added.
          Given that we want to know when this amount exceeds
          <quantity>
            <mag>275</mag><unit base="gallon"/>
          </quantity>, we set this equation up as:
          <me>
            700t >275
          </me>

    <title>Translating Phrases into Algebraic Expressions and Equations/Inequalities</title>
    <p>
      Void of context,
      there are certain short phrases and expressions in English that have mathematical meaning,
      and might show up in a modeling scenario.
      The following table shows how to translate some of these common phrases into algebraic expressions.

      We can extend this to setting up equations and inequalities.
      Let's look at some examples.
      The key is to break a complicated phrase or sentence into smaller parts,
      identifying key vocabulary such as <q>is,</q> <q>of,</q>
      <q>greater than,</q> <q>at most,</q> etc.
