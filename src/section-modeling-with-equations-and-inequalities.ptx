    <introduction>
        <p>One purpose of learning math is to be able to model real-life situations and then use the model to ask and answer questions about the situation. In this lesson, we will examine the basics of modeling to set up an equation (or inequality).</p>

        <title>Setting Up Equations for Rate Models</title>

        <p>To set up an equation modeling a real world scenario, the first thing we need to do is identify what variable we will use. The variable we use will be determined by whatever is unknown in our problem statement. Once we've identified and defined our variable, we'll use the numerical information provided to set up our equation.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-savings-pattern">
            <statement>
                <p>A savings account starts with <m>\$500</m>. Each month, an automatic deposit of <m>\$150</m> is made. Write an equation that represents the number of months it will take for the balance to reach <m>\$1{,}700</m>.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">
                    <stack>
                        <p>To determine this equation, we might start by making a table in order to identify a general pattern for the total amount in the account after <m>m</m> months.</p>

                        <p>Using this pattern, we can determine that an equation showing the unknown number of months, <m>m</m>, when the total savings equals <m>\$1700</m> would look like this: <me>500+150m=1700</me></p>
                    </stack>

        <remark>
            <p>To determine the solution to the equation in <xref ref="example-savings-pattern">Example</xref>, we could continue the pattern in <xref ref="table-savings-pattern">Table</xref>:</p>

            <sidebyside margins="0%" widths="47% 47%">
                <p>We can see that the value of <m>m</m> that makes the equation true is <m>8</m> as <m>500+150(8)=1700</m>. Thus it would take <m>8</m> months for an account starting with <m>\$500</m> to reach <m>\$1{,}700</m> if <m>\$150</m> is saved each month.</p>

                    <p>Since this problem refers to <em>when</em> the amount of water will reach a certain amount, we immediately know that the unknown quantity is time. As the volume of water in the tub is measured in <quantity><unit base="foot" exp="3"/></quantity> per minute, we know that time needs to be measured in minutes. We'll define <m>t</m> to be the number of minutes that water is poured into the tub. To determine this equation, we'll start by making a table of values:</p>

        <title>Setting Up Equations for Percent Problems</title>

        <p><xref ref="section-percentages">Section</xref> reviewed some basics of working with percentages, and even solved some one-step equations that were set up using percentages. Here we look at some scenarios where there is an equation to set up based on percentages, but it is slightly more involved than a one-step equation.</p>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>Jakobi's annual salary as a nurse in Portland, Oregon, is <m>\$73{,}290</m>. His salary increased by <m>4\%</m> from last year. Write a linear equation modeling this scenario, where the unknown value is Jakobi's salary last year.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>We need to know Jakobi's salary last year. So we'll introduce <m>s</m>, defined to be Jakobi's salary last year (in dollars). To set up the equation, we need to think about how he arrived at this year's salary. To get to this year's salary, his employer took last year's salary and added <m>4\%</m> to it. Conceptually, this means we have:
                <me>(\text{last year's salary})+(4\%\text{ of last year's salary}) = (\text{this year's salary})</me>
                We'll represent <m>4\%</m> of last year's salary with <m>0.04s</m> since <m>0.04</m> is the decimal representation of <m>4\%</m>. This means that the equation we set up is:
                <me>s+0.04s=73290</me>
                </p>

                    <p>Kirima offered to pay the bill and tip at a restaurant where she and her freinds had dinner.

                    <p>A common mistake is to translate a question like this into <q>what is <m>19\%</m> of <m>\$150</m>?</q> as a way to calculate the tip amount, and then subtract that from <m>\$150</m>. But that is not how tipping works. The tip percentage is applied to the original bill, not the final total. If we let <m>x</m> represent the original bill, then:<md>

            <solution>
                <p>We'll let <m>c</m> be the original price of the refrigerator. To obtain the discounted price, we take the original price and subtract <m>15\%</m> of that amount. Conceptually, this looks like:

        <title>Setting Up Equations for Geometry Problems</title>
        <p>With geometry problems and algebra, there is often the possibility to draw some picture to help understand the scenario better. Additionally it is often necessary to rely on some formula from geometry, such as the formulas from <xref ref="subsection-perimeter-and-area">Subsection</xref>.</p>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>An Olympic-size swimming pool is rectangular and <quantity><mag>50</mag><unit base="meter" /></quantity> in length. We don't know its width, but we do know that it required <quantity><mag>150</mag><unit base="meter" /></quantity> of painter's tape to outline the edge of the pool during recent renovations. Use this information to set up an equation that models the width of the pool.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <sidebyside widths="59% 35%" margins="0%">
                    <p>Since the pool's shape is a rectangle, it helps to sketch a rectangle representing the pool as in <xref ref="figure-olympic-pool">Figure</xref>. Since we know its length is <quantity><mag>50</mag><unit base="meter" /></quantity>, it is a good idea to label that in the sketch. The width is our unknown quantity, so we can use <m>w</m> as a variable to represent the pool's width in meters and label that too.</p>

                <p>Since it required <quantity><mag>150</mag><unit base="meter" /></quantity> of painter's tape to outline the pool, we know the perimeter of the pool is <quantity><mag>150</mag><unit base="meter" /></quantity>. This suggests using the perimeter formula for a rectangle: <m>P=2(\ell+w)</m>. (This formula was discussed in <xref ref="subsection-perimeter-and-area">Subsection</xref>).</p>

                <p>With this formula, we can substitute <m>150</m> in for <m>P</m> and <m>50</m> in for <m>\ell</m>:<me>150=2(50+w)</me> and this equation models the width of the pool.</p>

        <title>Setting Up Inequalities for Models</title>
        <p>In general, we'll model using inequalities when we want to determine a maximum or minimum value. To identify that an inequality is needed instead of an equality, we'll look for phrases like <em>at least, at most, at a minimum</em> or <em>at a maximum</em>.</p>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>The car share company car2go has a one-time registration fee of <m>\$5</m> and charges <m>\$14.99</m> per hour for use of their vehicles. Hana wants to use car2go and has a maximum budget of <m>\$300</m>. Write a linear inequality representing this scenario, where the unknown quantity is the number of hours she uses their vehicles.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>We'll let <m>h</m> be the number of hours that Hana uses car2go. We need the initial cost and the cost from the hourly charge to be less than or equal to <m>\$300</m>, which we set up as:
                    <me>5+14.99h \le 300</me>
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>When an oil tank is decommissioned, it is drained of its remaining oil and then re-filled with an inert material, such as sand. A cylindrical oil tank has a volume of <quantity><mag>275</mag><unit base="gallon"/></quantity> and is being filled with sand at a rate of <quantity><mag>700</mag><unit base="gallon"/></quantity> per hour. Write a linear inequality representing this scenario, where the time it takes for the tank to overflow with sand is the unknown quantity.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>The unknown in this scenario is time, so we'll define <m>t</m> to be the number of hours that sand is poured into the tank. (Note that we chose hours based on the rate at which the sand is being poured.) We'll represent the amount of sand poured in as <m>700t</m> as each hour an additional <quantity><mag>700</mag><unit base="gallon"/></quantity> are added. Given that we want to know when this amount exceeds <quantity><mag>275</mag><unit base="gallon"/></quantity>, we set this equation up as:
                    <me>700t >275 </me>
                </p>
