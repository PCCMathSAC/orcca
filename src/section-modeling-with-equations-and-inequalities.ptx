      To set up an equation modeling a real world scenario,

      The variable we use will be determined by whatever is unknown in our problem statement.
      Once we've identified and defined our variable,

          Right now we are not interested in actually solving this equation

    <title>Setting Up Equations for Percent Problems</title>
    <p permid="ETK">
      <xref ref="section-percentages">Section</xref> reviews some basics of working with percentages,
      and even solves some one-step equations that are set up using percentages.
      Here we look at some scenarios where there is an equation to set up based on percentages,
      but it things are a little more complicated than with a one-step equation. One important fact is that when doing math with percentages, we always start by rewriting the percentage as a decimal. For example, <m>18\%</m> should be written as <m>0.18</m> if you are going to us it to do algebra or arithmetic.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-salary-increase" permid="EqU">

          Jakobi's annual salary as a nurse in Portland, Oregon, is <m>\$73{,}290</m>.
          His salary increased by <m>4\%</m> from last year.
          Write a linear equation modeling this scenario,
          where the unknown value is Jakobi's salary last year.

          We want to work with Jakobi's salary last year.
          So we'll introduce <m>s</m>, defined to be Jakobi's salary last year (in dollars).
          To set up the equation, we need to think about how he arrived at this year's salary.
          To get to this year's salary, his employer took last year's salary and added <m>4\%</m> to it.
          Conceptually, this means we have:
          <me permid="VRV"> (\text{last year's salary})+(4\%\text{ of last year's salary}) = (\text{this year's salary}) </me>
          We'll represent <m>4\%</m> of last year's salary with <m>0.04s</m> since <m>0.04</m> is the decimal representation of <m>4\%</m>.

              But that is not how tipping works.
              The <m>19\%</m>is applied to the <em>original bill</em>, not the <em>final total</em>.
