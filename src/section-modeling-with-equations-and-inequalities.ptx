    <introduction>
        <p>One purpose of learning math is to be able to model real-life situations and then use the model to ask and answer questions about the situation. In this lesson, we will cover the basics of modeling.</p>

        <title>Setting Up Equations for Models</title>

        <p>To set up an equation modeling a real world scenario, the first thing we need to do is identify what variable we will use. The variable we use will be determined by whatever is unknown in our problem statement. Once we've identified and defined our variable, we'll use the numerical information provided to set up our equation.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-savings-pattern">

            <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">
                <stack>
                    <p>A savings account starts with <m>\$500</m>. Each month, an automatic deposit of <m>\$150</m> is made. Write an equation that represents the number of months it will take for the balance to reach <m>\$1{,}700</m>.</p>

                    <p>To determine this equation, we'll start by making a table in order to identify a general pattern for the total amount in the account after <m>m</m> months:</p>
                </stack>

                <table xml:id="table-savings-pattern">

                    </tabular>
                </table>
            </sidebyside>

            <p>Using this pattern, we can determine that an equation showing the unknown number of months, <m>m</m>, when the total savings equals <m>\$1700</m> would look like this:
                <me>500+150m=1700</me>
            </p>
        </example>

        <remark>
            <p>To determine the solution to the equation in <xref ref="example-savings-pattern">Example</xref>, we can continue the pattern in <xref ref="table-savings-pattern">Table</xref>:</p>

            <sidebyside margins="0%" widths="47% 47%">
                <p>We can see that the value of <m>m</m> that makes the equation true is <m>8</m> as <m>500+150(8)=1700</m>. Thus it would take <m>8</m> months for an account starting with <m>\$500</m> to reach <m>\$1{,}700</m> if <m>\$150</m> is saved each month.</p>

        <p>In the previous example, we were able to determine the solution by creating a table and using inputs that were integers. Often the solution will not be something we are able to arrive at this way. We will need to solve for it using algebra, as we'll see in later sections. For this section, we'll only focus on setting up the equation.</p>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>A bathtub contains <quantity><mag>2.5</mag><unit base="foot" exp="3"/></quantity> of water. More water is being poured in at a rate of <quantity><mag>1.75</mag><unit base="foot" exp="3"/></quantity> per minute. Write an equation representing when the amount of water in the bathtub will reach <quantity><mag>6.25</mag><unit base="foot" exp="3"/></quantity>.</p>
        </statement>
            <solution>
                <sidebyside margins="0%" widths="47% 47%">
                    <p>Since this problem refers to <em>when</em> the amount of water will reach a certain amount, we immediately know that the unknown quantity is time. As the volume of water in the tub is measured in <quantity><unit base="foot" exp="3"/></quantity> per minute, we know that time needs to be measured in minutes. We'll define <m>t</m> to be the number of minutes that water is poured into the tub. To determine this equation, we'll start by making a table of values:</p>

                <p>Using this pattern, we can determine that the equation representing when the amount will be <quantity><mag>6.25</mag><unit base="foot" exp="3"/></quantity> is:
                    <me>2.5+1.75t=6.25</me>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>Jakobi's annual salary as a nurse in Portland, Oregon, is <m>\$73{,}290</m>. His salary increased by <m>4\%</m> from last year. Write a linear equation modeling this scenario, where the unknown value is Jakobi's salary last year.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>We need to know Jakobi's salary last year. So we'll introduce <m>s</m>, defined to be Jakobi's salary last year (in dollars). To determine how to set up this equation, we need to think about how he arrived at this year's salary. To get to this year's salary, his employer took last year's salary and added <m>4\%</m> to it. Conceptually, this means we have:
                    <me>(\text{last year's salary})+(4\%\text{ of last year's salary}) = (\text{this year's salary})</me>
                We'll represent <m>4\%</m> of last year's salary with <m>0.04s</m> since <m>0.04</m> is the decimal representation of <m>4\%</m>. This means that the equation we set up is:
                    <me>s+0.04s=73290</me>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>The price of a refrigerator after a <m>15\%</m> discount is <m>\$612</m>. Write a linear equation modeling this scenario, where the original price of the refrigerator (before the discount was applied) is the unknown quantity.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>We'll let <m>c</m> be the original price of the refrigerator. To obtain the discounted price, we take the original price and subtract <m>15\%</m> of that amount. Conceptually, this looks like:
                    <me>(\text{original price})-(15\%\text{ of the original price})= (\text{discounted price})</me>
                Since the amount of the discount is <m>15\%</m> of the original price, we'll represent this with <m>0.15c</m>. The equation we set up is then:
                    <me>c-0.15c=612</me>

The radius of the cup is <quantity><mag>1.3125</mag><unit base="inch"/></quantity>. Write a linear equation modeling this scenario. (Hint: The volume for a cone is <m>\frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h</m>.)</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>We know that we need to find the height of this cone. So we'll introduce <m>h</m>, defined to be the height of the cone in inches. We know that the units need to be inches because the radius is also given in inches and the volume is given in cubic inches. Using the provided values <m>r=1.3125</m> and <m>V=6.3</m> and the formula for a cone's volume, we set this equation up as:
                    <me>\frac{1}{3}\pi (1.3125)^2 h = 6.3 </me>

        <title>Setting Up Inequalities for Models</title>
        <p>In general, we'll model using inequalities when we want to determine a maximum or minimum value. To identify that an inequality is needed instead of an equality, we'll look for phrases like <em>at least, at most, at a minimum</em> or <em>at a maximum</em>.</p>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>The car share company car2go has a one-time registration fee of <m>\$5</m> and charges <m>\$14.99</m> per hour for use of their vehicles. Rafael wants to use car2go and has a maximum budget of <m>\$300</m>. Write a linear inequality representing this scenario, where the unknown quantity is the number of hours he uses their vehicles.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>We'll let <m>h</m> be the number of hours that Rafael uses car2go. We need the initial cost and the cost from the hourly charge to be less than or equal to <m>\$300</m>, which we set up as:
                    <me>5+14.99h \le 300</me>
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>When an oil tank is decommissioned, it is drained of its remaining oil and then re-filled with an inert material, such as sand. A cylindrical oil tank has a volume of <quantity><mag>275</mag><unit base="gallon"/></quantity> and is being filled with sand at a rate of <quantity><mag>700</mag><unit base="gallon"/></quantity> per hour. Write a linear inequality representing this scenario, where the time it takes for the tank to overflow with sand is the unknown quantity.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>The unknown in this scenario is time, so we'll define <m>t</m> to be the number of hours that sand is poured into the tank. (Note that we chose hours based on the rate at which the sand is being poured.) We'll represent the amount of sand poured in as <m>700t</m> as each hour an additional <quantity><mag>700</mag><unit base="gallon"/></quantity> are added. Given that we want to know when this amount exceeds <quantity><mag>275</mag><unit base="gallon"/></quantity>, we set this equation up as:
                    <me>700t >275 </me>
