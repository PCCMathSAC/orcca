      One purpose of learning math is to be able to model real-life situations and then use the model to ask and answer questions about the situation.
      In this lesson,
      we will examine the basics of modeling to set up an equation
      (or inequality).

    <title>Setting Up Equations for Rate Models</title>
    <p permid="YMB">
      To set up an equation modeling a real world scenario,
      the first thing we need to do is identify what variable we will use.
      The variable we use will be determined by whatever is unknown in our problem statement.
      Once we've identified and defined our variable,
      we'll use the numerical information provided to set up our equation.

      reviewed some basics of working with percentages,
      and even solved some one-step equations that were set up using percentages.
      Here we look at some scenarios where there is an equation to set up based on percentages,
      but it is slightly more involved than a one-step equation.

          His salary increased by <m>4\%</m> from last year.
          Write a linear equation modeling this scenario,

          We need to know Jakobi's salary last year.
          So we'll introduce <m>s</m>, defined to be Jakobi's salary last year
          (in dollars).
          To set up the equation,
          we need to think about how he arrived at this year's salary.
          To get to this year's salary,
          his employer took last year's salary and added <m>4\%</m> to it.
          Conceptually, this means we have:

            (\text{last year's salary})+(4\%\text{ of last year's salary}) = (\text{this year's salary})

          We'll represent <m>4\%</m> of last year's salary with <m>0.04s</m> since <m>0.04</m> is the decimal representation of <m>4\%</m>.

      We can extend this to setting up equations and inequalities.
      Let's look at some examples.
      The key is to break a complicated phrase or sentence into smaller parts,
      identifying key vocabulary such as <q>is,</q> <q>of,</q>
      <q>greater than,</q> <q>at most,</q> etc.
