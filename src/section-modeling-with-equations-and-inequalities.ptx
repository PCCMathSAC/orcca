  <introduction>
    <p>
      One reason why math is important is that it allows you to model real-life situations
      and then use that model to ask and answer questions about the real world.
      In this section, we practice setting up an equation (or inequality) from a contextualized
      scenario, and this is a form of modeling.

      Complete sentences may be communicating an equation or inequality. We suggest breaking up
      sentences into smaller parts. There is usually a word or phrase that corresponds to the equals
      sign or one of the inequality symbols. For example <q>is</q> may corrrespond to an equals sign.
      These words/phrases are emphasized in this table.

      Practice with translating these English phrases and sentences into math expressions, equations,
      and inequalities will be helpful for word problems that do have context. In the exercises for
      this section, you will find such practice exercises.

    <title>Rate Models</title>
    <p>
      A <term>rate</term> is a measurement that tells us how much one quantity is changing with               <idx><h>Rate</h></idx>
      respect to how some other quantity is changing. For example, the number of people on earth
      is growing by about <m>2.6</m> people per second. Time is passing second by second, and as
      that change in time happens, we have a net gain of about <m>2.6</m> people. The rate we are
      discussing is <m>2.6\,\frac{\text{people}}{\text{s}}</m>. Note that the unit on this rate is
      fractional<mdash/>this is common with rates.
    </p>

    <p>
      One common class of modeling applications involve rates like these. Let's examine a first
      example.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-savings-pattern">
      <p>
        Your savings account starts with <m>\$500</m>. Then each month, there is an automatic
        deposit of <m>\$150</m>. You need <m>\$1700</m> to afford a deposit on a new apartment.
        Write an equation where the solution represents how much time this will take.
      </p>

      <p>
        Do you have an understanding of each of the numbers in this setting, and what they truly
        mean in context? The <m>500</m> is a number that only matters <em>once</em> in the story of
        this bank account: it is how much money was there when we started making automatic deposits.
        The <m>1700</m> also only matters <em>once</em>: at the end, we will have that much money.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the <m>150</m> is different. Month after month, the account balance goes up
        by <m>\$150</m>. This number is used repeatedly in the scenario. It might look like it's
        just a dollar amount, but it's actually a <em>rate</em>:
        it's <m>150\,\frac{\text{dollar}}{\text{month}}</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have any uncertainty about understanding a rate value, it can help to make a table.
        We know the account balance is changing month by month, so it makes sense to track the
        months and the account balance.
      </p>

      <tabular>
        <col halign="center" />
        <col halign="center"/>
        <row header="yes" bottom="medium">
          <cell>

          <cell>
            <line>Total Amount Saved</line>

        <row>
          <cell><m>3</m></cell>
          <cell><m>950</m></cell>
        </row>
      </tabular>

      <p>
        In the first column, we go up by one month from one row to the next. In the second
        column, we go up by <m>\$150</m> from one row to the next. If you are able to build a table
        like this, then you are dealing with a rate. In the second column, values increase by
        <m>150</m> dollars. In the first column, values increase by <m>1</m> month. The rate we
        are working with comes from dividing these:
        <m>\frac{150\,\text{dollars}}{1\,\text{month}}</m>, which is just
        <m>150\,\frac{\text{dollar}}{\text{month}}</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that we've spent time making sure we understand the meaning of the numbers in this
        story, we can try to do what we were asked to do: write an equation where the solution
        represents how much time it will take to reach <m>\$1700</m>. It's kind of a big deal to
        <em>clearly identify what variable</em> we will use. Our task is to write an equation where
        the solution represents <q>how much time<ellipsis/></q> and we are measuring time in months.
        So one perfectly fine choice we can make is to let <m>m</m> be our variable, where <m>m</m>
        stands for the number of months it will take to reach <m>\$1700</m>. (Another common choice
        would be to use <m>t</m>, since it stands for an amount of time.)
      </p>

      <p>
        What will the equation look like? For this example, let's return to the table we made
        earlier. Was there a pattern connecting the left column to the right column? For example in
        the left column there is a row where <m>3</m> months have passed. At that time, we have
        <m>\$950</m>. How did that <m>\$950</m> come about? Well, we started with <m>\$500</m> and
        then added <m>\$150</m> not once, not twice, but three times. As an equation:
        <me>
          500+150(3)=950
        </me>
        Thinking in this manner, we can grow the table to show this pattern and extend it to when
        <m>m</m> months have passed, even without a value in mind for <m>m</m>.

        We want there to be <m>\$1700</m> at the end, so apparently we want:
        <me>
          500 + 150m = 1700
        </me>
        And that was our objective: to write down that equation. Right now we are not interested in
        actually solving this equation. The skill of <em>setting up</em> that equation is
        challenging enough, and this section only focuses on that setup.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p>
      There are some things worth noticing in this last example. There was a <em>starting value</em>
      for the account balance (<m>\$500</m>), a <em>rate</em> at which the account balance was
      changing (<m>150\,\frac{\text{dollars}}{\text{month}}</m>), and a <em>final value</em>
      (<em>$1700</em>). In the end, we had the equation
      <men xml:id="men-rate-model">
        (\text{initial value}) \pm (\text{rate})\cdot\text{variable} = (\text{final value})
      </men>
      and the variable represented how much the other quantity (time in this case, not the account
      balance) has changed. The <m>\pm</m> is a <m>+</m> if the quantity is growing, and is a
      <m>-</m> if the quantity is reducing. This is a common setup for most modeling with rates.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-bathtub">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A bathtub contains
          <quantity>
            <mag>2.5</mag><unit base="foot" exp="3"/>
          </quantity>
          of water.
          More water is being poured in at a rate of
          <quantity>
            <mag>1.75</mag><unit base="foot" exp="3"/>
          </quantity>
          per minute. Write an equation where the solution represents when the amount of water in
          the bathtub will reach
          <quantity>
            <mag>6.25</mag><unit base="foot" exp="3"/>
          </quantity>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          In this example, we have an initial amount of water
          (<quantity>
            <mag>2.5</mag><unit base="foot" exp="3"/>
          </quantity>),
          a rate at which the amount of water is changing
          (<quantity>
            <mag>1.75</mag><unit base="foot" exp="3"/>
          </quantity>),
          and a final amount of water we are going to reach
          (<quantity>
            <mag>6.25</mag><unit base="foot" exp="3"/>
          </quantity>).
          So we can use the pattern for rate modeling from <xref ref="men-rate-model"/>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We should clearly identify the variable first though. The solution is supposed to
          represent an amount of time. So a reasonable variable to use is <m>t</m>. Let <m>t</m>
          be the amount of time, in minutes, that it takes for the tub to reach
          <quantity>
            <mag>6.25</mag><unit base="foot" exp="3"/>
          </quantity>.
          And we have the equation:
          <me>
            2.5 + 1.75t = 6.25
          </me>

    <title>Percent Applications</title>                                                                       <idx><h>Percent</h><h>applications</h></idx>
    <p>
      <xref ref="section-percentages"/> reviews the fundamentals of working with percentages.
      Here we look at some scenarios where there is an equation to set up based on percentages.
      One important consideration is that when doing math with percentages, it's almost always best
      to rewrite each percentage as a decimal. For example, <m>18\%</m> should be written as
      <m>0.18</m> if you are going to use it to do algebra or arithmetic.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-salary-increase">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Jakobi's annual salary as a nurse this year is <m>\$73{,}290</m>. That's following a
          <m>4\%</m> raise over last year's salary. Write a linear equation modeling this scenario,
          where the solution represents Jakobi's salary from the previous year.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          As soon as you understand that the solution will be Jakobi's salary from last year, that
          is when you should clearly define a variable. Since it will represent a salary, we choose
          to use <m>S</m> as the variablbe. Let <m>S</m> represent Jakobi's salary from last year.
        </p>
        <p>
          To set up the equation, we need to think about how he arrived at this year's salary.
          His employer took last year's salary and added <m>4\%</m> to that. In a diagram, we have:
          <me>
            (\text{last year's salary})+(4\%\text{ of last year's salary}) = (\text{this year's salary})
          </me>
          We represent <q><m>4\%</m> of last year's salary</q> with <m>0.04S</m> since <m>0.04</m>
          is the decimal equivalent to <m>4\%</m>. So out equation is:
          <me>
            S + 0.04S = 73290
          </me>
          For now we are not tryign to solve this equation, just practice setting it up.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      We can see a pattern here that may help with future percent applications.
      <men xml:id="percent-model">
        (\text{initial value}) \pm (\text{percent as decimal})\cdot(\text{initial value}) = (\text{final value})
      </men>
      In Jakobi's sutuation, his salary rose, so the <m>\pm</m> symbols would be a <m>+</m>.
      We can imagine other applications (like a discount at a clothing store) where the initial
      value is reduced, and then the <m>\pm</m> symbol would be a <m>-</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The variable in Jakobi's situation is the initial value of something. So as you can see,
      it appears twice in the equation. This is common with percent application modeling.

            Kirima offered to pay the bill and tip at a restaurant where she and her friends had
            dinner. In total she paid <m>\$150</m> even, which meant the tip was a little more than
            <m>19\%</m>. We'd like to know what was the bill before tip. Set up an equation for this
            situation.

        <solution>
          <p>
            A common mistake is to translate a question like this into <q>what is <m>19\%</m> of
            <m>\$150</m>?</q> as a way to calculate the tip amount, and then subtract that from
            <m>\$150</m>. But that is not how tipping works. The <m>19\%</m>is applied to the
            <em>original bill</em>, not the <em>final total</em>. So please read carefully.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we let <m>x</m> represent the original bill, we can apply <xref ref="percent-model"/>

      <solution>
        <p>
          We'll let <m>p</m> be the original price of the refrigerator. To obtain the discounted

    <title>Inequalities in Modeling</title>
    <p>
      Occasionally an equation is not the most appropriate tool for a model, and an inequality is
      better. To identify when an inequality is more appropriate, look for words/phrases like
      <q>at least</q>, <q>at most</q>, <q>minimum</q>, <q>maximum</q>, <q>no more than</q>,
      <q>no less than</q>, and more.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The car share company Zipcar has a one-time registration fee of <m>\$35</m> and charges
          <m>\$9.50</m> per hour for use of their vehicles. Hana wants to use Zipcar this semester
          and has a maximum budget of <m>\$300</m>. Write a linear inequality representing this
          scenario, where the solution set represents all the possibilities for how many hours total
          this semester that she could use a Zipcar vehicle.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The solution will reperesnt a number of hours which is an amount of time. So we choose to
          use <m>t</m> as the variable. Let <m>t</m> be the nubmer of hours that Hana drives a
          Zipcar this semester.
        </p>
        <p>
          This exercise is much like the rate exercises from <xref ref="subsection-rate-models"/>.
          We have an initial expense: the <m>\$35</m> one-time registration fee. We have a rate:
          <m>9.50\,\frac{\text{dollar}}{\text{hour}}</m>. And we have a final cost to work with:
          <m>\$300</m>. However we are not exacly trying to make Hana blow through her entire budget,
          so it's not appropriate to write the equation <m>35 + 9.50t = 300</m>. The <m>\$300</m> is
          her <em>maximum</em>. It's totally fine (and encouraged!) for her to spend less than that.
          So we need to set this up using an inequality symbol. We need
          <md>
            <mrow>(\text{registration fee}) + (\text{cost of hours driven}) \amp\leq (\text{budget maximum})</mrow>
            <mrow>35 + 9.50t \amp\leq 300</mrow>
          </md>
          For now it is enough to write down this inequality, and we can work on solving it later.

            set represents how many students may have been at PCC in spring 2010.
          </p>
          <instruction>
            Use <c>x</c> for the variable.
          </instruction>
          <p>
            <var name="$equation" width="25" />
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We decide to let <m>x</m> represent the enumber of students enrolled at PCC in spring
            2010. This is an <q>initial value</q> in the sense of <xref ref="percent-model"/>.
            But we do not want to write an equation, because we were told that community colleges
            experienced <em>over</em> a <m>37\%</m> enrollment decline, not exactly a <m>37\%</m>
            decline. So we write the following:
            <md>
              <mrow>(\text{initial value}) \pm (\text{percent as decimal})\cdot(\text{initial value}) \amp\mathrel{?} (\text{final value})</mrow>
              <mrow>x - 0.37x \amp\mathrel{?} 25957</mrow>
            </md>
            But what inequality symbol makes sense here? If the decline was <em>more</em> than
            <m>37\%</m>, then <m>x</m> started out larger than what it would have to be for
            <m>x - 0.37x</m> to equal <m>25957</m>. So we need a greater than sign:
            <me>
              x - 0.37x \gt 25957
            </me>
            Once again, we do not need to try to solve this. We are content for now to write it
            down.
