      Using the decision tree can guide us when we are given an expression to factor.

          Following the decision tree,
          we now have a trinomial where the leading coefficient is <m>1</m> and we need to look for factors of <m>-10</m> that add to <m>3</m>.
          We find that <m>-2</m> and <m>5</m> work.
          So, the full factorization is:

          Start by noting that the GCF is <m>1</m>,
          and there is no GCF to factor out.
          We continue along the decision tree for a trinomial.
          Notice that both <m>64</m> and <m>81</m> are perfect squares and that this expression might factor using the pattern <m>A^2+2AB+B^2=(A+B)^2</m>.
          To find <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>,
          take the square roots of the first and last terms,
          so <m>A=8d</m> and <m>B=9</m>.
          We have to check that the middle term is correct:
          since <m>2AB=2(8d)(9)=144d</m> matches our middle term,
          the expression must factor as
          <me permid="PhL">

            10x^2y-12xy^2=2xy(5x-6y)
          </me>.
          Since we have a binomial inside the parentheses,
          the only options on the decision tree for a binomial involve squares or cubes.
          Since there are none, we conclude that
          <m>2xy(5x-6y)</m> is the complete factorization.

          Start by noting that the GCF is <m>1</m>,

          We continue along the decision tree for a binomial and notice that we now have a difference of squares,
          <m>A^2-B^2=(A-B)(A+B)</m>.
          To find the values for <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> that fit the patterns,
          just take the square roots.
          So <m>A=3b</m> since <m>(3b)^2=9b^2</m> and <m>B=5y</m> since <m>(5y)^2=25y^2</m>.
          So, the expression must factor as

          Following the decision tree,
          we now have a trinomial inside the parentheses where <m>a\neq1</m>.
          We should try the AC method because neither <m>8</m> nor <m>-3</m> are perfect squares.
          In this case,
          <m>ac=-24</m> and we must find two factors of <m>-24</m> that add to be <m>2</m>.
          The numbers <m>6</m> and <m>-4</m> work in this case.
          The rest of the factoring process is:

          Following the decision tree, we now have a binomial with a sum of cubes.

          So using the sum of cubes formula,

          We now have a trinomial where both the first term, <m>9</m>,
          and last term, <m>16y^2</m>, look like perfect squares.
          To use the perfect squares difference pattern,
          <m>A^2-2AB+B^2=(A-B)^2</m>,
          recall that we need to mentally take the square roots of these two terms to find <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.

          However, we cannot apply the perfect squares method to this problem because it worked when <m>2AB=24y</m>.

          In this case,
          <m>ac=144</m> and we need to come up with two factors of <m>144</m> that add to be <m>-25</m>.
          After a brief search,
