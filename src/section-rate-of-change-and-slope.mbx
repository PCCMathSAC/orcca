    	<title>Introduction to Slope</title>

    	<p><em>Scenario:</em> On <abbr>Dec.</abbr> 31, Matthew found that he had only <m>5</m> dollars left in his piggy bank. He decided to save <m>3</m> dollars per day in the new year and not spend any. We can model the amount of money in his piggy bank with a linear equation: <m>y=3x+5\text{.}</m> The number in front of <m>x\text{,}</m> <m>3\text{,}</m> is the rate of change (<m>3</m> dollars per day). We give it a special name in math: <term>slope</term>.</p>

    	<p>Let's build a table to model the amount of money Matthew has saved in the scenario above.</p>

		<p>Matthew saves <m>3</m> dollars per day; as a result, in the table, each time when <m>x</m> increases by <m>1\text{,}</m> <m>y</m> increases by <m>3\text{.}</m> This is how we find a linear relationship's slope from a table of data.</p>

		<p>Note that when <m>x</m> increases by <m>2\text{,}</m> <m>y</m> increases by <m>6\text{.}</m> The rate of change (slope) is still <m>\frac{6}{2}=3\text{.}</m></p>

		<p>Here are some scenarios with different slopes. Note that a slope is more meaningful with units.<ul>
			<li>If a tree grows <m>2.5</m> feet every year, to model the tree's height, the slope would be <m>2.5</m> feet per year.</li>
			<li>If a company loses <m>2</m> millions dollars every year, to model the amount of total loss, the slope would be <m>-2</m> million dollars per year.</li>
			<li>If Cara has stopped growing, to model her height, the slope would be <m>0</m> inches per year.</li>
		</ul></p>

		<p>Next, we will see how to find slope in a graph. Let's put the amount of Matthew's saved money into a graph according to <xref ref="matthew-money">Table</xref></p>

            <description>This is a Cartesian grid with the following points: (0,5),(1,8),(2,11),(3,14),(5,20), with a few slope triangles. The first one starts at (0,5), goes through (1,5), and ends at (1,8). The base of the triangle is labeled "1 day," and the height is labeled "3 dollars". The last slope triangle starts at (3,14), goes through (5,14), and ends at (5,20). The base of the triangle is labeled "2 days," and the height is labeled "6 dollars". The other two slope triangles don't have labels. One starts at (1,8), goes through (2,8) and ends at (2,11). The other one starts at (2,11), goes through (3,11), and ends at (3,14).</description>

        <p>We call triangles in the graph <term>slope triangles</term>, because they can tell us this line's slope:<ul>
        	<li>The smaller slope triangle on the left side implies: When <m>1</m> day passes, <m>3</m> dollars are saved. The line's slope is <m>\frac{3}{1}=3</m> dollars per day.</li>
        	<li>The bigger slope triangle on the top right implies: When <m>2</m> days pass, <m>6</m> dollars are saved. The line's slope is <m>\frac{6}{2}=3</m> dollars per day.</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>Both slope triangles give us the same slope. This implies, to find a line's slope, we can choose any two points on the line, draw a slope triangle, and then do a division. Many math textbooks use the formula <me>\text{slope}=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}</me>In the smaller slope triangle, <m>\text{rise}=2\text{,}</m> and <m>\text{run}=1\text{.}</m> Feel free to use that formula, but this textbook will use the formula <men xml:id="slope-definition-formula">\text{slope} =\frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x} =\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</men>By math convention, we use the Greek letter <m>\Delta</m> to represent <q>change</q>. We choose not to use the first formula because when a slope is negative, the phrase <q>change in <m>y</m></q> is better than the word <q>rise.</q></p>

        <p>We could have drawn the slope triangle in a different way:</p>

        </figure>

        <p>Drawing a slope triangle this way would imply: "Each time when <m>6</m> dollars are saved, <m>2</m> days pass." Compare this with drawing <em>change in <m>x</m></em> first, which implies "When <m>2</m> days pass, <m>6</m> dollars are saved." The latter approach makes more sense. Mathematically, it's ok to use both ways to draw slope triangles, and we will get the same answer. However, in this textbook, we will always draw <em>change in <m>x</m></em> first.</p>

We have realized we didn't make a good choice of points. We should instead choose points with integer coordinates:</p>

		        <p>Notice that <em>change in <m>y</m></em> is negative, because the amount of gas is decreasing. Since we chose points with integer coordiantes, we can easily calculate the slope:<me>\text{slope}=\frac{-2}{3}=-\frac{2}{3}</me> In the given context, the slope implies gas in the tank is decreasing at the rate of <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> gallons per hour. Another way to understand the slope is: Gas in the tank is decreasing by <m>2</m> gallons every <m>3</m> hours.</p>

		<p>By <xref ref="slope-definition-formula">Formula</xref>, we have:<ul>
			<li>In Effie's line, <m>\text{slope}=\frac{4}{3}</m> meters per second</li>
			<li>In Ivan's line, <m>\text{slope}=\frac{2}{1}=2</m> meters per second</li>
			<li>In Cleo's line, <m>\text{slope}=\frac{3}{1}=3</m> meters per second</li>
		</ul></p>
		
		<p>In a time-distance graph, the slope of a line represents speed. We can clearly see this relationship from the slope triangles, such as <m>2</m> meters per second in the second graph. Another important relationship we can see is that, the more sharply a line is slanted, the bigger the slope is (Note that the opposite is true for negative slopes). This should make sense because for each passing second, the faster person travels longer, making a slope triangle's height taller.</p>

        <p>The first segment (blue) started from <m>(0,0)</m> and stopped at <m>(3,12)\text{.}</m> This implies, Emiliano started at the starting point, traveled <m>3</m> hours and reached a point <m>12</m> miles from the starting point. By the slope triangle, his speed in this segment was <m>4</m> miles per hour.</p>

        <p>The third segment (black) started from <m>(5,12)</m> and stopped at <m>(9,0)\text{.}</m> This implies, Emiliano started from a spot <m>12</m> miles away from the starting point, traveled <m>4</m> hours and returned to the starting point. By the slope triangle, his speed in this segment was <m>-3</m> miles per hour. The negative slope implies he was traveling backward.</p>

        <p>What happened in the second segment (red), which started at <m>(3,12)</m> and ended at <m>(5,12)\text{?}</m> This implies he started at a point <m>12</m> miles from the starting point, and didn't move for <m>2</m> hours. His speed in this segment was <m>0</m> miles per hour. So, <em>a horizontal line's slope is <m>0\text{.}</m></em></p>

        <p>If we try to draw a slope triangle for the second segment, once we draw the triangle's base from <m>(3,12)</m> to <m>(5,12)\text{,}</m> we cannot draw the height; or, the height of the slope triangle is <m>0\text{.}</m> As a result, the slope of this segment is <m>\text{slope}=\frac{0}{2}=0</m> miles per hour.</p>

        <p>To summarize what we learned:<ul>
         	<li>For a linear relationship, as its <m>x</m>-value increases, if the line goes up, its slope is positive. The more sharply a line is slanted, the bigger its slope.</li>
         	<li>For a linear relationship, as its <m>x</m>-value increases, if the line goes down, its slope is negative. The more sharply a line is slanted, the smaller its slope. For example, a line with a slope of <m>-4</m> is slanted more sharply than a line with a slope of <m>-3\text{,}</m> but <m>-4\lt-3\text{.}</m></li>
         	<li>If a line is horizontal, its slope is <m>0\text{.}</m></li>

        <p>The horizontal line's slope is <m>0\text{.}</m> As the line is slanted more and more sharply, its slope becomes bigger and bigger. By this pattern, the vertical line's slope would be infinitely large. We say a vertical line's slope is <em>undefined</em>, or the slope <em>does not exist</em>. We will learn when horizontal and vertical lines are used in future lessons.</p>

		<title>Finding Slope by Two Given Points</title>

		<p>Earlier, we learned how to find a line's slope by drawing a slope triangle. In this section, we will learn how to find a line's slope without drawing a slope triangle. We will start with a video lecture as an overview.</p>

		<figure><video youtube="WkspBxrzuZo" width="70%" /></figure>

		<p>In the next example, we will learn how to find a line's slope with the slope formula.</p>

		<p><em>Scenario:</em> Since planted, a tree has been growing at a constant rate for a few years. By the end of the third year, the tree was <m>15</m> feet tall; by the end of the sixth year, the tree was <m>27</m> feet tall. What's the rate of growth (slope of the line)?</p>

		<p>First, we will sketch a graph for this scenario.</p>

        <p>By the slope triangle, we have:<md>
            <mrow>\text{slope} \amp =\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\frac{27-15}{6-3}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\frac{12}{3}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =4 \text{ feet per year}</mrow>
        </md></p>

        <p><q>Change in <m>y</m></q> means <q>difference in <m>y\text{.}</m></q> To find two numbers' difference, we use subtraction. In the graph, we can observe that:<ul>
        	<li><q>Change in <m>y</m></q> can be calculated by <m>27-15</m> (a subtraction between two <m>y</m>-values);</li>
        	<li><q>Change in <m>x</m></q> can be calculated by <m>6-3</m> (a subtraction between two <m>x</m>-values);</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>We can label <m>(3,6)</m> as <m>(\overset{x_1}{3},\overset{y_1}{6})\text{,}</m> and label <m>(6,27)</m> as <m>(\overset{x_2}{6},\overset{y_2}{27})\text{.}</m> Here, <m>x_1</m> and <m>y_1</m> represent the first point's <m>x</m>-value and <m>y</m>-value, and <m>x_2</m> and <m>y_2</m> represent the second point's <m>x</m>-value and <m>y</m>-value. It's important to use subscript instead of superscript, because <m>y_2</m> and <m>y^2</m> mean different things! Now we can write an equivalent formula of <xref ref="slope-definition-formula">Equation</xref>:<men xml:id="slope-formula">\text{slope}=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</men>We name it the <term>slope formula.</term> The following graph will help you understand why this formula works. Basically, we are still using a slope triangle to calculate the slope.</p>

	    <p>The beauty of slope formula is, to find a line's slope, we don't need to draw a slope triangle any more. Let's look at an example.</p>

	    <example>
	    	<statement>
				<p>A line passes the points <m>(-5,25)</m> and <m>(4,-2)\text{.}</m> Find this line's slope.</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>If you are new to this formula, it's important to label each number before using the formula. Those two given points are:<me>(\overset{x_1}{-5},\overset{y_1}{25}) \text{ and } (\overset{x_2}{4},\overset{y_2}{-2})</me>Next, we use the slope formula:
					<md>
            			<mrow>\text{slope}\amp=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</mrow>
            			<mrow>\amp=\frac{-2-(25)}{4-(-5)}</mrow>
            			<mrow>\amp=\frac{-27}{9}</mrow>
            			<mrow>\amp=-3</mrow>
        			</md>
        		</p>
				<p>Note the importance of using parentheses when we substitute in numbers!</p>
			</solution>
