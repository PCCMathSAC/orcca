        <p>Adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, and raising to powers each have peculiarities when using negative numbers. This section reviews arithmetic with signed (both positive and negative) numbers.</p>

        <title>Signed Numbers</title><idx><h>signed numbers</h></idx>

        <p>Is it valid to subtract a large number from a smaller one? It may be hard to imagine what it would mean physically to subtract <m>8</m> cars from your garage if you only have <m>1</m> car in there in the first place. Nevertheless, mathematics has found a way to give meaning to expressions like <m>1-8</m> using <term>signed numbers</term>.</p>

        <p>In daily life, the signed numbers we might see most often are temperatures. Most people on Earth use the Celsius scale; if you're not familiar with the Celsius temperature scale, think about these examples:</p>

            <title>Subtraction Sign versus Negative Sign</title>
            <p>Unfortunately, the symbol we use for subtraction looks just like the symbol we use for marking a negative number. It will help to identify when a <q>minus</q> sign means <q>subtract</q> or means <q>negative.</q> The key is to see if there is a number to its left, not counting anything farther left than an open parenthesis. Here are some examples.<ul>
                <li>
                    <p><m>-13</m> has one negative sign and no subtraction sign.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><m>20-13</m> has no negative signs and one subtraction sign.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><m>-20-13</m> has a negative sign and then a subtraction sign.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><m>(-20)(-13)</m> has two negative signs and no subtraction sign.</p>

        <title>Adding</title>

        <p>An easy way to think about adding two numbers with the <em>same sign</em> is to simply (at first) ignore the signs, and add the numbers as if they were both positive. Then make sure your result is either positive or negative, depending on what the sign was of the two numbers you started with.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-add-two-negative">
            <title>Add Two Negative Numbers</title>

            <p>If you needed to add <m>-18</m> and <m>-7</m>, note that both are negative. Maybe you have this expression in front of you:<me>-18+-7</me> but that <q>plus minus</q> is awkward, and in this book you are more likely to have this expression:<me>-18+(-7)</me> with extra parentheses. (How many subtraction signs do you see? How many negative signs?)</p>

            <p>Since <em>both</em> our terms are <em>negative</em>, we can add <m>18</m> and <m>7</m> to get <m>25</m> and immediately realize that our final result should be negative. So our result is <m>-25</m>:<me>-18+(-7)=-25</me></p>
        </example>

        <p>This approach works because adding numbers is like having two people tugging on a rope in one direction or the other, with strength indicated by each number. In <xref ref="example-add-two-negative">Example</xref> we have two people pulling to the left, one with strength <m>18</m>, the other with strength <m>7</m>. Their forces combine to pull <em>left</em> with strength <m>25</m>, giving us our total of <m>-25</m>, as illustrated in <xref ref="figure-working-together">Figure</xref>.</p>

        <p>If we are adding two numbers that have <em>opposite</em> signs, then the two people tugging the rope are opposing each other. If either of them is using more strength, then the overall effect will be a net pull in that person's direction. And the overall pull on the rope will be the <em>difference</em> of the two strengths. This is illustrated in <xref ref="figure-working-in-opposition">Figure</xref>.</p>

        <p>Perhaps you can handle a subtraction such as <m>18-5</m>, where a small positive number is subtracted from a larger number. There are other instances of subtraction that might leave you scratching your head. In such situations, we recommend that you view each subtraction as <em>adding</em> the opposite number.</p>

        <title>Multiplying</title>

        <p>Making sense of multiplication of negative numbers isn't quite so straightforward, but it's possible. Should the product of <m>3</m> and <m>-7</m> be a positive number or a negative number? Remembering that we can view multiplication as repeated addition, we can see this result on a number line:</p>

        <p>What about the product <m>-3\cdot(-7)</m>, where both factors are negative? Should the product be positive or negative?

        <title>Powers</title>
        <p>For early sections of this book the only exponents you will see will be the <term>natural numbers</term><idx><h>natural numbers</h></idx>: <m>\{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}</m>. But negative numbers can and will arise as the <em>base</em> of a power.</p>

        <p>An exponent is a shorthand for how many times to multiply by the base. For example, <me>(-2)^5\text{ means }\overbrace{(-2)\cdot(-2)\cdot(-2)\cdot(-2)\cdot(-2)}^{5\text{ instances}}</me></p>

        <p>Will the result here be positive or negative? Since we can view <m>(-2)^5</m> as repeated multiplication, and we now understand that multiplying two negatives gives a positive result, this expression can be thought of this way:<me>\underbrace{\underbrace{(-2)\cdot(-2)}_{\text{positive}}\cdot\underbrace{(-2)\cdot(-2)}_{\text{positive}}}_{\text{positive}}\cdot(-2)</me> and that lone last negative number will be responsible for making the final product negative.</p>

        <p>More generally, if the base of a power is negative, then whether or not the result is positive or negative depends on if the exponent is even or odd. It depends on whether or not the factors can all be paired up to <q>cancel</q> negative signs, or if there will be a lone factor left by itself.</p>

        <p>Once you understand whether the result is positive or negative, for a moment you may forget about signs. Continuing the example, you may calculate that <m>2^5=32</m>, and then since we know <m>(-2)^5</m> is negative, you can report <me>(-2)^5=-32</me></p>

        <warning>
            <title>Negative Signs and Exponents</title>
            <p>Expressions like <m>-3^4</m> may not mean what you think they mean. What base do you see here? The correct answer is <m>3</m>. The exponent <m>4</m> <em>only</em> applies to the <m>3</m>, not to <m>-3</m>. So this expression, <m>-3^4</m>, is actually the same as <m>-\mathopen{}\left(3^4\right)\mathclose{}</m>, which is <m>-81</m>. Be careful not to treat <m>-3^4</m> as having base <m>-3</m>. That would make it equivalent to <m>(-3)^4</m>, which is <em>positive</em> <m>81</m>.</p>

            <li>
                <title>Addition</title>
                <p>Add two negative numbers: add their positive counterparts and make the result negative.</p>
                <p>Add a positive with a negative: find their difference using subtraction, and keep the sign of the dominant number.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <title>Subtraction</title>
                <p>Any subtraction can be converted to addition of the opposite number. For all but the most basic subtractions, this is a useful strategy.</p>
            </li>

                <title>Multiplication</title>
                <p>Multiply two negative numbers: multiply their positive counterparts and make the result positive.</p>
                <p>Multiply a positive with a negative:  multiply their positive counterparts and make the result negative.</p>
                <p>Multiply any number by <m>0</m>: the result will be <m>0</m>.</p>

                <title>Division (not discussed in this section)</title>
                <p>Division by some number is the same as multiplication by its reciprocal. So the multiplication rules can be adopted.</p>
                <p>Division of <m>0</m> by any nonzero number always results in <m>0</m>.</p>
                <p>Division of any number by <m>0</m> is always undefined.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <title>Powers</title>
                <p>Raise a negative number to an even power: raise the positive counterpart to that power.</p>
                <p>Raise a negative number to an odd power: raise the positive counterpart to that power, then make the result negative.</p>
                <p>Expressions like <m>-2^4</m> mean <m>-\mathopen{}\left(2^4\right)\mathclose{}</m>, not <m>(-2)^4</m>.</p>
