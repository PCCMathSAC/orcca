      Unless we're presented with such news items,
      most of us deal with numbers no larger than the thousands in our daily life.
      In science, government, business,
      and many other disciplines,
      it's not uncommon to deal with much larger numbers.
      When numbers get this large,
      it can be hard to distinguish between a number that has nine or twelve digits.
      On the other hand,
      we have descriptive language that allows us grasp the value and not be lost in the sheer size of the number.
    </p>

    <p permid="Hoa">
      We have descriptive language for all numbers,
      based on the place value of the different digits:
      ones, tens, thousands, ten thousands, etc.
      We tend to rely upon this language more when we start dealing with larger numbers.
      Here's a chart for some of the most common numbers we see and use in the world around us:

      Each number above has a corresponding power of ten and this power of ten will be important as we start to work with the content in this section.
    </p>

    <p permid="TCs">
      This descriptive language also covers even larger numbers:
      trillion, quadrillion, quintillion,
      sextillion, septillion, and so on.
      There's also corresponding language to describe very small numbers,
      such as thousandth, millionth,
      billionth, trillionth, etc.
    </p>

    <p permid="zJB">
      Through centuries of scientific progress,
      humanity became increasingly aware of very large numbers and very small measurements.
      As one example,
      the star that is nearest to our sun is <url href="https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/features/cosmic/nearest_star_info.html">Proxima Centauri</url><fn>
      <url href="https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/features/cosmic/nearest_star_info.html">imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/features/cosmic/nearest<underscore/>star<underscore/>info.html</url>
      </fn>.
      Proxima Centauri is about <m>25{,}000{,}000{,}000{,}000</m> miles from our sun.
      Again, many will find the descriptive language easier to digest: Proxima Centauri is about <m>25</m> trillion miles from our sun.
    </p>

    <p permid="fQK">
      To make computations involving such numbers more manageable,
      a standardized notation called <term>scientific notation</term> was established.
      The foundation of scientific notation is the fact that multiplying or dividing by a power of <m>10</m> will move the decimal point of a number so many places to the right or left,
      respectively.

    <title>Scientific Notation for Large Numbers</title>
    <p permid="Yml">
      To write a numbers larger than <m>10</m> in scientific notation,
      we write a decimal point after the first non-zero digit of the number and then count the number of places between where the decimal point originally was and where it now is.
      Scientific notation communicates the size of a number and the order of magnitude just as quickly,
      but with no need to write long strings of zeros or to try to decipher the language of quintillions,
      sextillions, etc.
    </p>
<!--          That number of place values is the order of magnitude of the number and becomes the exponent placed on the <m>10</m>.  Numbers larger than or equal to 10 will always have a positive exponent on ten and therefore a positive order of magnitude. </p>

        <p>If we stop and this about this for a moment, we're taking a large number and reducing it to a number between one and ten.  To have this number keep the same value, we need to multiply by a positive power of 10.  </p>

        <p>To change Proxima Centauri's distance to the sun (about 40,208,000,000,000 km) to scientific notation, we first place the decimal point after the <m>4</m> to obtain <m>4.0208</m>, and then multiply this number by <m>10^{13}</m>, the magnitude of the original number.  Proxima Centauri's distance to our sun is about <m>4.0208 \times 10^{13}</m> km. We can see, compared to standard notation, scientific notation can quickly, yet more accurately, express the magnitude of a number.</p>
        <p>Writing out in standard notation, 4 being followed by 13 other digits quickly communicates the size of the number. -->

      with <em>negative</em> integer exponents on <m>10</m>.

    <p permid="kAD">
      To see how this works with a digit other than <m>1</m>,
      let's look at <m>0.05</m>.
      When we state <m>0.05</m> as a number,
      we say <q>5 hundredths.</q> Thus <m>0.05=5\times \frac{1}{100}</m>.
      The fraction <m>\frac{1}{100}</m> can be written as <m>\frac{1}{10^2}</m>,
      which we know is equivalent to <m>10^{-2}</m>.
      Using negative exponents,
      we can then rewrite <m>0.05</m> as <m>5\times10^{-2}</m>.
      This is the scientific notation for <m>0.05</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="QHM">
      In practice, we won't generally do that much computation.
      To write a small number in scientific notation we start as we did before and place the decimal point behind the first non-zero digit.
      We then count the number of decimal places between where the decimal had originally been and where it now is.
      Keep in mind that negative powers of ten are used to help represent very small numbers
      (smaller than <m>1</m>)
      and positive powers of ten are used to represent very large numbers
      (larger than <m>1</m>).
      So to convert <m>0.05</m> to scientific notation, we have:
      <me permid="aby">
        0\overbrace{.\highlight{05}}^{2\text{ places}}=5\times 10^{-2}
      </me>
    </p>

    <example permid="pdf">
      <p permid="UHL">
        In quantum mechanics,
        there is an important value called the <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant">Planck Constant</url><fn>
        <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck<underscore/>constant</url>
        </fn>.
        Written as a decimal, the value of the Planck constant
        (rounded to 4 significant digits)
        is
        <me permid="GiH">
          0.0000000000000000000000000000000006626
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p permid="AOU">
        In scientific notation,
        this number will be <m>6.626\times 10^{\mathord{?}}</m>.
        To determine the exponent,
        we need to count the number of places from where the decimal is when the number is written as
        <me permid="mpQ">
          0.0000000000000000000000000000000006626
        </me>
        to where it will be when written in scientific notation:
        <me permid="SwZ">
          0\overbrace{.\highlight{0000000000000000000000000000000006}}^{34\text{ places}}626
        </me>
        As a result, in scientific notation,
        the Planck Constant value is <m>6.626 \times 10^{-34}</m>.
        It will be much easier to use <m>6.626 \times 10^{-34}</m> in a calculation,
        and an added benefit is that scientific notation quickly communicates both the value and the order of magnitude of the Planck constant.

      One main reason for having scientific notation is to make calculations involving immensely large or small numbers easier to perform.

      Often when we multiply or divide numbers in scientific notation,

        <intertext>While this is a correct value, it is not written using scientific notation. One way to covert this answer into scientific notation is to turn just the coefficient into scientific notation and momentarily ignore the power of ten:</intertext>

      suppose we have to find the area of a square whose radius is <m>3\times 10^7</m> feet.
      To perform this calculation,
      we first remember the formula for the area of a square,
      <m>A=s^2</m> and then substitute  <m>3\times 10^7</m> for <m>s</m>:
      <m>A = \left( 3\times 10^7 \right)^2</m>.
      To perform this calculation,
      we'll need to remember to use the <xref ref="item-exponent-rules-product-to-a-power" text="title">product to a power rule</xref>
      and the <xref ref="item-exponent-rules-power-to-a-power" text="title">power to a power rule</xref>:
